Izzy's apartment was a controlled explosion of organized chaos. Stacks of books threatened to topple from every surface, interspersed with ancient pottery shards, rolled-up maps, and half-disassembled surveying equipment. The air smelled of old paper, dust, and a faint, lingering hint of sandalwood incense – her father’s favorite. In the center of it all, bathed in the cool glow of a high-intensity desk lamp, was the map.

Izzy chewed on the end of a pen, her brow furrowed in concentration. The transcribed coordinates from the map were spread across her oversized monitor, alongside a dizzying array of topographical maps, satellite images, and historical records. She'd been at it for hours, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the sheer adrenaline rush of the chase.

"Okay, Serpent God," she muttered, tapping a fingernail against the screen. "Where are you hiding?"

She zoomed in on a section of the Amazon basin, a vast, unbroken expanse of green that seemed to swallow the digital cursor. The coordinates, even with her father's meticulous notes, were frustratingly vague. The 'bend in the river,' for example, could refer to any one of a hundred serpentine twists in the Rio Negro. The 'uniquely shaped mountain peak'… well, the Amazon wasn't exactly known for its towering mountains.

"This is like finding a specific grain of sand on a beach that stretches for a thousand miles," she grumbled, pushing back from the desk and stretching her stiff neck. Her 'office' was actually a converted loft above a noisy Brazilian restaurant. The rhythmic thump of samba music vibrated faintly through the floorboards, a constant, pulsing reminder of the vibrant world outside her self-imposed academic exile.

She glanced at a framed photo on her desk – her and her father, grinning broadly, standing in front of a crumbling Mayan temple. He looked so *alive* in the picture, his eyes sparkling with that infectious enthusiasm that had always drawn her into his world of ancient mysteries and forgotten civilizations.

"Come on, Papa," she whispered, her voice catching slightly. "Give me something. A little nudge in the right direction."

Izzy returned to the screen, her gaze drifting over the satellite images. She scrolled through countless iterations of river bends, comparing them to her father's sketches. She cross-referenced historical accounts of indigenous tribes, searching for any mention of a 'serpent god' or a city built in its honor. She even delved into obscure meteorological records, trying to pinpoint the exact location where the specified constellation would have been visible on the date indicated in her father's notes.

"This constellation thing is a dead end," she concluded after another hour of fruitless searching. "It's too imprecise. The viewing angle changes too much over even a small area."

Izzy leaned back, running a hand through her tangled hair. Doubt, a cold, insidious serpent of its own, began to coil in her stomach. Was she wasting her time? Was this whole thing just a fool's errand?

She caught a glimpse of her own reflection in the darkened window – tired eyes, smudged mascara, a determined set to her jaw that seemed to waver slightly.

"No," she said aloud, her voice firm, pushing back the doubt. "He wouldn't have left this for me if it wasn't real. He *believed* in it."

Izzy took a deep breath and returned to the river. This time, instead of focusing on the precise shapes of the bends, she looked at the surrounding terrain. She pulled up a layer on the map showing elevation, then another showing vegetation density. She began to filter the data, looking for a confluence of factors that might narrow down the search.

"Okay, let's assume the 'uniquely shaped mountain peak' is more of a… prominent hill," she mused. "And let's assume the 'bend in the river' is one that's… unusually deep, maybe with… specific types of vegetation on its banks."

She started to mark potential locations, each one a tiny pinprick of hope in the vastness of the digital jungle. The samba music downstairs had shifted to a faster, more frenetic rhythm, mirroring the quickening beat of her own heart.

Then, she saw it.

A small, almost imperceptible anomaly in the elevation data. A slight rise, barely registering as a hill, but with a distinctive, almost… serpentine shape. And right next to it, a sharp bend in a tributary of the Rio Negro, a bend that matched, almost perfectly, one of her father's sketches. The vegetation density around this particular bend was also unique, showing a higher concentration of a specific type of palm tree that her father had meticulously documented in his notebooks.

Izzy leaned closer, her breath catching in her throat. She cross-referenced the location with the constellation data. It wasn't a perfect match, but it was… close. Closer than anything else she'd found.

"Could it be…?" she whispered, her fingers trembling as she zoomed in further.

She overlaid a historical map, one showing the known territories of various indigenous tribes. The location fell within the historical boundaries of the Yanomani people, a tribe known for their fierce independence and… their legends of a powerful serpent spirit that guarded a sacred city.

Izzy sat back, staring at the screen, a slow smile spreading across her face. The pieces were falling into place. The vague coordinates, the cryptic clues, the seemingly impossible task… it all led to this one, tiny, almost insignificant spot on the map.

"The City of the Serpent God," she said, the words filled with awe and a burgeoning sense of triumph. "I found you."
The doubt was gone, replaced by the exhilarating surge, the pure, unadultered joy of discovery. She put up some coffee, ready to start planning the expedition.

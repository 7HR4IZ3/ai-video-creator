The office, if it could even be called that, was more of a sensory deprivation chamber designed with an eye for excruciatingly expensive minimalism. Walls were vast, unbroken planes of polished, bone-white concrete. The floor, a seamless expanse of black marble, reflected the cold, recessed lighting like a still, obsidian pool. There was no art, no personal touches, nothing to suggest a human presence beyond the massive, black glass desk that dominated the room. Behind it, Vargas sat, a figure sculpted from sharp angles and controlled stillness, his dark suit blending seamlessly with the shadows. He was staring at a holographic projection shimmering in the air before him – a swirling, three-dimensional map of the Amazon basin.

Lieutenant Cortez stood before the desk, his posture rigid, the faint tremor in his hands betraying the tension he felt. He was younger than Vargas, his face less hardened, a flicker of something almost like empathy occasionally disturbing the carefully constructed mask of professional detachment.

"The signal originated from Manaus, sir," Cortez reported, his voice crisp and devoid of inflection. "A secure network, heavily encrypted, but our team managed to pinpoint the source. It was a brief transmission, but… significant."

Vargas’s fingers, long and elegant, danced across the surface of the desk, manipulating the holographic map. He zoomed in on Manaus, the city lights pulsing like a miniature galaxy. "Significant how?"

"The transmission contained data packets consistent with… topographical analysis. High-resolution scans, focused on a particular region of the Rio Negro." Cortez hesitated, glancing at the map. "The area matches the projected location of… the target."

Vargas remained silent, his gaze fixed on the swirling data. He didn't need to ask what 'the target' was. They both knew. The City of the Serpent God. A myth, a legend, a prize he'd been chasing for years. A prize that was now, seemingly, within reach, thanks to the unwitting actions of a young woman named Izzy.

"Isabella Rossi," Vargas said, the name a low, almost sibilant whisper. "The daughter."

"Yes, sir," Cortez confirmed. "She accessed her father's files. The coded map. We believe she's deciphered the final clue."

Vargas finally looked up, his eyes, the color of polished obsidian, meeting Cortez's. There was no warmth in them, no hint of humanity. Only a cold, calculating intelligence. "She knows the location." It wasn't a question.

"We believe so, sir."

Vargas steepled his fingers, the silence in the room pressing down like a physical weight. The only sound was the faint hum of the holographic projector and the almost imperceptible rasp of Vargas's breathing.

"She presents me with a dilema," Varges said, his voice smooth and low. "Do I grab her now, or do I let her lead us? She is, after all, amature. She will need help."

Cortez shifted his weight, the movement almost imperceptible. "We have teams in place, sir. We could intercept her immediately. Secure the location."

Vargas gave a slight, almost dismissive wave of his hand. "Patience, Lieutenant. She's a resourceful one, this Isabella Rossi. She's already gotten this far without our… assistance. Let her do the groundwork. Let her navigate the initial hurdles. The jungle is a formidable opponent, even for the experienced."

He paused, a flicker of something that might have been amusement crossing his lips. "Besides, I want to see how far she gets. A test, of sorts. To gauge her… potential."

Cortez swallowed, the faint tremor in his hands returning. He knew what Vargas meant by 'potential'. It wasn't about Isabella Rossi's skills as an explorer. It was about her usefulness. And once that usefulness was exhausted…

"And when she's served her purpose, sir?" Cortez asked, the question barely audible.

Vargas's eyes narrowed, a predatory gleam in their depths. "Then we eliminate the loose ends. Her, anyone she's contacted, anyone who might know anything. Complete deniability. We were never there."

Cortez nodded, his face pale. "Understood, sir. But… the jungle, sir. It's unpredictable. There are… factors we can't control." He thought of the stories he'd heard, whispers of ancient curses, of tribal warriors, of things lurking in the darkness that defied explanation.

Vargas dismissed his concerns with a curt gesture. "We have the best technology, the best training, the best… motivation. Nothing will stand in our way. Dispatch the teams. Tell them to shadow her. Observe, but do not engage. Not yet."

"Yes, sir," Cortez replied, turning to leave. He paused at the threshold, a question lingering in his mind, a question he knew he shouldn't ask. But the words slipped out anyway.

"And if she… if she finds something, sir? Something… dangerous?"

Vargas smiled, a slow, chilling curve of his lips. "Then, Lieutenant," he said, his voice a silken whisper, "we let the jungle deal with her. And we collect the spoils."

Cortez nodded, his stomach churning with a mixture of dread and a strange, unsettling sense of anticipation. He walked out, leaving Vargas alone in the sterile, silent office, the holographic map of the jungle swirling before him like a vortex, ready to swallow anyone who dared to venture too close. The hunt had begun.

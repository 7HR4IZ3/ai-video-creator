Dust swirled in the air, thick and choking. Vargas coughed, spitting grit onto the already ravaged plaza. The ground beneath his boots trembled with each new blast of energy that ripped through the ancient city. Around him, his remaining mercenaries scrambled for cover, their faces a mixture of terror and awe. The city was alive, and it was angry.

He spotted him then, the Double-Crossing Mercenary (DCM) slinking away from the rest, heading towards a gap in the collapsed wall that might lead to some semblance of escape. Vargas’s jaw tightened. He’d known, hadn't he? Known what activating the city’s defenses would truly unleash. The man had pushed for them to follow Izzy, even when it seemed too risky. Vargas felt a cold satisfaction settle in his gut, a twisted pleasure in the knowledge that he was about to deal with this particular loose end.

"Rios!" Vargas roared, his voice barely audible over the city's destructive symphony.

The DCM froze, his back stiffening. He slowly turned, his eyes darting around the plaza, searching for an escape route that wasn't there. Vargas saw the flicker of panic, the desperate calculation. Good. Let him feel it.

"Vargas," Rios said, his voice strained, attempting a casualness that failed miserably. "Just… checking on our escape route. Making sure we have options."

Vargas stalked towards him, each step deliberate, each footfall crunching on shattered stone. His hand instinctively went to the heavy pistol holstered at his hip. He savored the weight of it, the promise of finality.

"Options?" Vargas echoed, his voice low and dangerous. "You knew, didn’t you? You knew what would happen when she activated the city."

Rios swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing nervously. "I… I suspected. Ancient defenses, you know how they are. But I didn't think it would be like this."

"Like this?" Vargas laughed, a harsh, humorless sound that echoed in the ruined plaza. "This is beyond anything you could have imagined, isn't it? This is death on a scale you couldn't even dream of." He gestured around with his free hand. "And you led us here. You betrayed us."

"No, Vargas, listen!" Rios pleaded, taking a step back. "I can explain. I thought… I thought we could control it. Use the city's power for ourselves. Think of the riches, the influence!"

Vargas stopped a few feet away, close enough to smell the man's fear, the sweat clinging to his temples. The other mercenaries watched from a distance, their faces impassive. They knew what was coming. They understood the price of betrayal in Vargas's world.

"Riches? Influence?" Vargas sneered. "You pathetic fool. You thought you could control a force like this?" He gestured to the chaotic energy ripping through the city. "You thought you could bargain with oblivion?"

Rios's eyes widened. "We can still get out of here, Vargas! We can find another way. I know the city better than you do. I can lead us–"

"Silence!" Vargas roared, the sound cutting through Rios's desperate pleas. He drew his pistol, the cold steel glinting in the flickering light. "You had your chance. You chose to betray me. You chose to endanger my men. Now you pay the price."

Rios's face crumpled, the bravado vanishing, replaced by pure, unadulterated terror. "Vargas, please! Don't do this! We can work something out! I have information, secrets–"

Vargas didn't hesitate. He raised the pistol, aiming for the center of Rios's forehead. The shot echoed through the plaza, a sharp, brutal sound that was quickly swallowed by the city's roar.

Rios’s eyes widened in disbelief just before the bullet ripped through his skull. He crumpled to the ground, his body twitching once, then lying still in the dust, a crimson stain blooming on the shattered stone.

Vargas lowered the pistol, the acrid smell of gunpowder filling the air. He looked at the other mercenaries, his gaze cold and unwavering.

"Let this be a lesson to all of you," he said, his voice hard and unforgiving. "Loyalty is everything. Disobey me, betray me, and you will suffer the same fate."

No one spoke. No one moved. They simply stared back at him, their faces etched with a mixture of fear and respect. They understood. Vargas had reaffirmed his control, had reminded them of the consequences of defiance.

He holstered his pistol, his eyes scanning the ruined city. Izzy was still out there, somewhere in this chaos. And she had something he wanted. He would find her. He would get what he came for. And anyone who stood in his way would suffer the same fate as Rios. The city could burn around him, but Vargas would not be denied.

The air hung thick and heavy, shimmering with the heat rising from the parched earth. The sun, a molten coin sinking towards the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the crumbling wall that marked the edge of the ancient city. Izzy, adrenaline coursing through her veins, scrambled back, the spear-wielding mercenary’s eyes boring into her. 

Marco roared, a guttural sound of pain and fury. He shoved the axe-wielding mercenary away, leaving a bloody gash across the man’s arm. Ignoring the burning pain in his side, he launched himself at Vargas.

"Get out of here, Izzy! Now!" Marco bellowed, his voice strained. He knew he was in no condition for a fight, but he couldn't let Vargas get to her. His life was worth Izzy escaping and finding her way back home.

Vargas barely had time to react. Marco’s machete flashed, a silver arc against the darkening sky. Vargas, caught off guard, barely managed to parry with his own blade, a curved kukri. Sparks showered as steel met steel.

"You fool!" Vargas snarled, his face twisting with rage, "You think you can stop me?" He recovered quickly, his movements fluid and practiced. He lunged, the kukri aimed at Marco's throat.

Marco sidestepped the blow, wincing as the movement twisted the wound in his side. He struck back, aiming for Vargas's arm, forcing the man to retreat. "Just giving her a chance!" he grunted, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

Izzy, seeing her opportunity, didn't hesitate. She knew Marco was buying her time, and she couldn't waste it. She scrambled towards the crumbling city gate, its massive stone blocks cracked and weathered by centuries of neglect.

The spear-wielding mercenary roared in frustration, turning to pursue her. But Marco, with a desperate surge of adrenaline, tackled him, sending them both crashing to the ground in a tangle of limbs.

"Get her!" Vargas shouted to the remaining, wounded mercenary, his eyes never leaving Marco. "Don't let her escape!"

The wounded man, clutching his bleeding arm, hesitated for a moment, then lurched forward, limping after Izzy.

Izzy reached the gate, her heart pounding in her chest. The city loomed before her, a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and shadowy alleyways. It was a dangerous place, but it was her only chance. She glanced back, seeing Marco locked in a brutal struggle with Vargas, their blades flashing in the fading light. The wounded mercenary was gaining on her.

"Marco, I owe you!" she yelled, then plunged into the darkness of the city.

Vargas heard her words and spat on the ground. "Sentimental fool," he muttered, his eyes narrowing. He drove his knee into Marco’s wounded side, eliciting a groan of pain. Marco’s grip on his machete loosened slightly. "This ends here."

"Not if I have anything to say about it," Marco rasped, his face pale with pain. He twisted, using Vargas's own weight against him, and managed to throw him off balance. He scrambled to his feet, ignoring the searing pain in his side.

Vargas, momentarily stunned, staggered back. He raised his kukri, his eyes burning with cold fury. He feinted left, then lunged right, aiming for Marco's heart.

Marco anticipated the move. He ducked under the blow, using the momentum to sweep Vargas's legs out from under him. Vargas crashed to the ground.

Before Vargas could recover, Marco was on him, straddling his chest, his machete raised high. "This is for Izzy," he growled, his voice filled with a raw, primal anger.

"You wouldn't dare!" Vargas spat, his eyes wide with fear.

Marco hesitated for a fraction of a second. He wasn't a killer. But he knew that if he let Vargas live, he would never stop hunting Izzy. He lowered the machete, the blade glinting in the fading light.

Suddenly, a searing pain ripped through his shoulder. He gasped, his grip on the machete faltering. Vargas seized the opportunity, shoving Marco off him and scrambling to his feet. The wounded mercenary had circled back, his crossbow aimed and smoking.

"Get up, Vargas. I got him!" the mercenary shouted.

Vargas ignored him, focusing his attention on Marco. “You should have killed me when you had the chance,” he said, his voice laced with venom. He raised his kukri, ready to deliver the final blow.

Marco knew he was beaten. He was wounded, exhausted, and outnumbered. But he had bought Izzy enough time. He had given her a chance. He closed his eyes, bracing himself for the inevitable.

"I slowed you down; now get her!" Marco spat.

Vargas grinned. "I will. And when I find her, I'll make sure she knows who sent me. That you died for nothing." He raised his kukri.

But before Vargas could strike, a deafening roar echoed through the city. The ground trembled beneath their feet. Dust and debris rained down from the crumbling buildings.

"What the hell was that?" the wounded mercenary yelled, his eyes wide with alarm.

Vargas hesitated, glancing around nervously. He sheathed his kukri. "Never mind. We'll deal with that later. Let's go!" He barked at his mercenary. "She can't have gone far."

Without a backwards glance at Marco, Vargas turned and disappeared into the city, following the wounded mercenary. Marco lay gasping on the ground, the pain in his side and shoulder almost unbearable. He watched as they vanished into the darkness, a grim satisfaction settling over him. Izzy was free. For now.

The city walls continued to crumble as Marco passed out.

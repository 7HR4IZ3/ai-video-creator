Dust choked the air, thick and acrid, stinging Izzy's eyes. Her ears rang with the echo of grinding stone and collapsing masonry. One moment, she'd been sprinting through the central chamber, the heart of the city, desperate to escape Vargas, the next, the floor had vanished beneath her. Now, she was sprawled on a pile of rubble, coughing and spitting grit.

"Vargas!" she yelled, her voice hoarse and strained. "You overgrown baboon! Where are you?"

A gruff voice, surprisingly close, answered, "Right here, sweetheart. And I think 'overgrown' is a tad redundant, don't you?"

Izzy scrambled to her feet, brushing dust from her already filthy clothes. The chamber, once grand and imposing, was now a chaotic jumble of broken pillars and fallen lintels. Light filtered weakly through cracks in the ceiling, illuminating the devastation. Vargas, remarkably unscathed, leaned against what remained of a massive stone archway, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Nice of you to join me in the basement," he said, pushing himself off the arch and taking a step towards her. "Though I must say, the decor leaves something to be desired."

"Basement?" Izzy echoed, her eyes scanning their surroundings. The floor had indeed given way, dropping them into a lower level, a space that clearly wasn't meant to be accessible. The air here was heavier, damper, and carried a faint, earthy smell.

"Don't tell me the great Isabella 'Izzy' Rodriguez didn't notice the subtle architectural flaws," Vargas chuckled, his hand instinctively moving to the pistol at his hip. "This whole place is coming down, piece by piece. Seems you triggered something big."

"I didn't—" Izzy began, then bit back the words. Arguing with Vargas was pointless. "We need to find a way out," she stated, her voice sharper now, laced with urgency.

"Oh, I agree," Vargas said, his eyes narrowing. "But first, we have some unfinished business." He took another step, closing the distance between them. "Marco sends his regards… from beyond the grave."

The words hit Izzy like a physical blow. Marco? Dead? She couldn't… wouldn't believe it.

"You're lying," she spat, her hands clenching into fists. "He wouldn't let you…" Her voice trailed off, the image of Marco's injured arm flashing in her mind.

"Lying? Me?" Vargas feigned offense, placing a hand over his heart. "I assure you, my dear Izzy, Marco is resting peacefully… or as peacefully as one can rest with a knife in their ribs."

Rage, raw and blinding, surged through Izzy. She lunged at Vargas, a guttural cry escaping her lips. She swung wildly, her fist connecting with his jaw. He staggered back, surprised by the force of her attack.

"Feisty, aren't we?" he growled, wiping blood from his mouth. He regained his balance, his eyes hardening. "Alright, let's see how long that fire lasts."

He moved with surprising agility for a man of his size, dodging her next blow and grabbing her wrist. He twisted it sharply, forcing her to her knees.

"Where is it, Izzy?" he hissed, his face close to hers. "Where is the Serpent's Heart? Don't play coy with me. I know you're close."

"Go to hell," Izzy gasped, pain radiating up her arm. She tried to wrench herself free, but his grip was like iron.

"Oh, I intend to," Vargas said, his voice dangerously low. "But not before I get what I came for." He tightened his grip on her wrist, the pressure intensifying. "Tell me, Izzy. Or I start breaking bones."

Suddenly, a massive chunk of the ceiling crashed down between them, throwing up a cloud of dust. Vargas stumbled back, momentarily distracted. Izzy seized the opportunity, kicking out with her foot and connecting with his shin. He roared in pain, releasing her wrist.

"This isn't over!" he bellowed, limping slightly.

Izzy ignored him, scrambling away from the falling debris. The entire chamber was groaning and shifting, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. She had to get out, and fast.

"Fine!" she yelled back, her voice barely audible above the din. "Rot in here!"

She turned and ran, disappearing into the gloom, leaving Vargas alone amidst the crumbling ruins. The last thing she heard was his enraged shout, quickly swallowed by the sound of the collapsing city.

The roar of the collapsing tunnel was a physical force, pressing against Izzy's eardrums, vibrating in her chest. Marco's grip on her arm was the only thing keeping her upright as he yanked her forward, deeper into the suffocating darkness.

"Faster, Izzy! Move!" His voice was raw, strained against the cacophony.

Izzy didn't need to be told twice. Fear was a cold, sharp spur in her gut. She scrambled over loose rocks, her boots slipping, her lungs burning. The beam of her headlamp bounced wildly, illuminating a nightmarish dance of falling debris. Chunks of rock the size of her head whizzed past, narrowly missing them. The air was thick with dust, choking her, making her eyes water.

"I can't… see!" she gasped, coughing, her voice a ragged whisper.

"Just keep running!" Marco shouted back, his voice tight with urgency. "Don't stop! Don't look back!"

But Izzy couldn't help it. For a split second, she glanced over her shoulder. The sight that met her eyes stole the breath from her lungs. The tunnel behind them was a churning vortex of rock and dust, a monstrous maw devouring the path they'd just traversed. The knife, the pressure plate, everything, was gone.

A particularly large slab of rock, dislodged from the ceiling, crashed down directly in front of them, blocking their path. Marco swore, a harsh, guttural sound lost in the din. He pulled Izzy to the right, towards a narrow fissure in the tunnel wall, a crack barely wide enough for them to squeeze through.

"In here!" he yelled, pushing her ahead of him. "Go, go, go!"

Izzy squeezed into the crevice, scraping her arms and legs against the rough rock. The space was claustrophobic, the walls pressing in on her, making it hard to breathe. She could feel Marco behind her, his body shielding her from the worst of the falling debris.

The rumbling continued, a relentless, terrifying tremor that seemed to shake the very foundations of the earth. Izzy squeezed her eyes shut, bracing herself for the inevitable. *This is it,* she thought. *This is how it ends.*

Then, as suddenly as it began, the roaring stopped. The tremors subsided, replaced by an eerie silence punctuated only by the sound of their ragged breathing and the occasional *tink* of small stones settling.

Marco was the first to speak, his voice hoarse. "Izzy? Are you alright?"

Izzy opened her eyes, blinking in the sudden, relative darkness. Dust still hung heavy in the air, but the immediate danger seemed to have passed. "I… I think so," she managed, her voice trembling. "What… what happened?"

"The tunnel… it stabilized," Marco said, his voice still tight with adrenaline. He coughed, trying to clear the dust from his throat. "We're lucky. That fissure… it probably saved our lives."

He shifted, trying to get a better look at their surroundings. The beam of his headlamp illuminated the narrow crevice they were huddled in. It extended for a few more feet, then opened into… another tunnel?

"We need to get out of here," Marco said, his voice regaining some of its strength. "This whole place could still come down."

He helped Izzy to her feet. She was shaking, her legs felt like jelly, but she managed to stand. They squeezed out of the fissure and back into the main tunnel, or what was left of it.

The scene that greeted them was one of utter devastation. The tunnel ahead was a chaotic jumble of rock and debris. The ceiling was partially collapsed, and the air was still thick with dust.

"My God," Izzy whispered, staring at the wreckage.

Marco shone his headlamp around. "The supplies…"

Izzy's heart sank. She had instinctively held on the smaller backpack. Her larger backpack, containing the bulk of their food, water, and, crucially, some of her father's reference materials for the map, was gone. It had been strapped to a frame just inside the entrance.

She scrambled towards the pile of rubble, her heart pounding with a desperate hope. She clawed at the rocks, ignoring the sharp edges that scraped her skin.

"Izzy, stop!" Marco said, grabbing her arm. "It's no use. It's buried."

Izzy looked up at him, her eyes filled with despair. "The food… the water… the notes…"

Marco’s expression was grim. “We’ll have to ration what we have left,” he said, his voice low. He pointed to the smaller pack still clinging to her. “We’ll have to make it last. And we’ll need to find another water source… quickly.”

He looked at the partially collapsed tunnel ahead. The passage, though choked with debris, was still navigable. It sloped downwards, continuing deeper into the earth.

"We have to keep moving," Marco said, his voice resolute. "We can't stay here."

Izzy nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She knew he was right. They had no choice. They had to push on, even with their dwindling supplies and the ever-present threat of another collapse. She looked back one last time at the mountain of rubble that had swallowed their supplies, a knot of grief and fear tightening in her chest. They had survived, but at a cost. The City of the Serpent God was proving to be far more dangerous than she had ever imagined.

The word "city" had barely left Izzy’s lips when the silence shattered. Not with the screech of bats or the groan of ancient stone, but with the unmistakable *thwack* of crossbow bolts impacting stone.

Izzy reacted on instinct. She yanked Marco back, diving behind a crumbling section of the wall as two bolts slammed into the space where they’d been standing. The sound reverberated through the chamber, a brutal counterpoint to the awed quiet of moments before.

"Ambush!" Marco roared, already drawing his machete. He crouched low, his eyes scanning the darkness.

"Vargas!" Izzy spat, adrenaline surging through her veins. She pulled her own pistol, the cold steel a small comfort in her trembling hand. "He was faster than we thought."

From the shadows emerged Vargas, a cruel smile twisting his lips. He stepped into the faint light emanating from…somewhere, his crossbow held at the ready. Behind him, two hulking mercenaries materialized, their faces grim and their weapons already drawn. One wielded a massive axe, the other a wickedly barbed spear.

“Welcome to my humble abode,” Vargas said, his voice dripping with mock politeness. “I must say, I’m impressed you made it this far. But all journeys must end, *no*?”

“We’re not afraid of you, Vargas,” Izzy said, trying to project a confidence she didn't feel. Her heart hammered against her ribs. It was a bad place to fight. She could have lost him in the jungle.

Vargas chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. “Brave words from a trapped rat. You have something I want, *muchacha*. And I always get what I want.” He gestured with the crossbow. “Hand over the map, and maybe, just maybe, I’ll let your friend live long enough to see the sun set one last time.”

Marco snarled, taking a step forward. “Go to hell!”

"Marco, stay back," Izzy warned, her eyes glued to Vargas. "Don't do anything stupid."

Vargas's smile widened, showing a flash of yellowed teeth. “Stupid? I think you're the stupid ones for thinking you could outrun me. I've been tracking you since the jungle." He spat on the ground. "And I'm not leaving without that map.”

Without warning, Vargas fired. The bolt whizzed past Izzy's head, embedding itself in the wall behind her with a sickening thud. It was a warning shot, but it was enough to shatter the fragile stalemate.

"Now!" Izzy yelled, firing her pistol.

The gunshot echoed deafeningly in the chamber. Vargas flinched, ducking behind one of his mercenaries. The mercenary roared in pain, clutching at his shoulder. Marco charged forward, his machete a silver blur in the dim light.

The mercenary with the axe met Marco’s charge, swinging his weapon in a wide arc. Marco ducked under the blow, bringing his machete up in a swift, precise strike. The axe deflected off the machete, sending sparks flying. Marco spun, slashing again. The mercenary roared, stumbling back.

Izzy, meanwhile, scrambled for better cover, firing at the remaining mercenary with the spear. The mercenary dodged behind a crumbling pillar, the spear held out in front of him like a viper’s fang. He lunged, the spear point aimed directly at Izzy’s chest.

She rolled to the side, narrowly avoiding the spear thrust. The tip of the spear scraped against her arm, tearing her jacket and drawing a thin line of blood. She gasped, scrambling back further.

Vargas, using the chaos as cover, moved to flank Marco. He raised his crossbow, aiming carefully.

Marco, locked in a brutal struggle with the axe-wielding mercenary, didn't see him coming.

"Marco, behind you!" Izzy screamed, but it was too late.

Vargas fired.

Marco grunted, staggering back. He clutched at his side, his face contorted in pain. Blood seeped between his fingers.

"Marco!" Izzy cried, scrambling to her feet. She raised her pistol, but the mercenary with the spear blocked her path, his eyes cold and merciless.

She had to get to Marco. But she was trapped, cornered between a relentless enemy and a wounded friend. The ethereal glow from the depths of the chamber seemed to mock her, a silent witness to her impending doom.

The spear-wielding mercenary lunged again. This time she might not be so lucky.

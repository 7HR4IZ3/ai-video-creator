The passage narrowed to a crawl. Marco cursed under his breath, his injured shoulder protesting with every inch he squeezed through. The air hung thick and stale, tasting of dust and decay. He could hear Izzy ahead of him, her own struggles punctuated by sharp intakes of breath. He pushed onward, driven by the primal need to escape, to survive.

Then, the tunnel opened abruptly, spitting them out into what remained of a street. Buildings had collapsed inwards, forming piles of rubble that clawed at the sky. Twisted metal rods protruded from the concrete like skeletal fingers. The air here was no better, thick with the smell of pulverized stone and something acrid, something vaguely… burnt.

Izzy stumbled out first, immediately scanning their surroundings. "This way," she rasped, pointing towards a gap in the debris that looked marginally less impassable than the rest. She took off at a sprint.

Marco followed, but his injured leg buckled beneath him. A searing pain shot up his thigh, and he cried out, clutching at a jagged piece of concrete for support. He was slowing Izzy down, he knew it. But he couldn’t help it. The fight with Vargas and his men had taken more out of him than he’d let on.

He pushed forward, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Each step was agony, a torturous reminder of his battered body. He could barely see Izzy now, a fleeting shadow disappearing into the maze of rubble.

A voice, cold and devoid of emotion, sliced through the air. "Going somewhere, Marco?"

He froze. It was Vargas.

Turning slowly, Marco saw him standing amidst the ruins, an inhuman figure silhouetted against the dull sky. Vargas’s face was a mask of grim satisfaction, his eyes burning with predatory hunger. Behind him, two of his men cautiously picked their way through the wreckage. They looked wary, their weapons drawn.

Marco straightened, ignoring the fire in his leg. "Vargas," he said, his voice low and strained. "I should have known you'd be too stubborn to die."

Vargas chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "You wound me, Marco. I thought we had a connection. You and I, chasing after the same prize." He gestured around him, a sweep of his hand encompassing the ruined city. "And now, here we are. Just you and me."

"Izzy has the map," Marco said, trying to buy time, to assess his chances. They were slim, bordering on nonexistent. He was injured, exhausted, and facing a man who seemed to thrive on violence.

Vargas’s smile widened, a chilling display of teeth. "The map is irrelevant. The real prize is the power, the knowledge." He took a step forward, and his men mirrored his movement, flanking him on either side. "And you, Marco, you're going to tell me where she went."

"Go to hell," Marco spat, shifting his weight, preparing to fight. He knew it was a futile gesture, a last act of defiance in the face of inevitable defeat.

Vargas sighed, a theatrical display of disappointment. "Such a waste. You had potential, Marco. You could have been useful."

He lunged.

The attack was swift and brutal. Vargas moved with a speed that belied his size, a whirlwind of fists and fury. Marco raised his arms to defend himself, but he was too slow. A blow connected with his jaw, sending a jolt of pain through his skull. He staggered back, his vision blurring.

Vargas pressed his advantage, unleashing a flurry of punches that pummeled Marco's body. He grunted with each impact, his ribs screaming in protest. He could feel the blood welling up in his mouth, the metallic tang of it coating his tongue.

He managed to land a blow of his own, a desperate punch to Vargas’s gut. Vargas barely flinched. He grabbed Marco’s injured arm, twisting it with a sickening crack.

Marco screamed, the sound swallowed by the ruins. He fell to his knees, his body wracked with pain.

Vargas stood over him, his face contorted with rage. He drew a long, wickedly sharp knife from his belt. The blade glinted in the dim light.

"Any last words, Marco?" he hissed, his voice dripping with malice.

Marco looked up at him, his eyes filled with defiance. "Izzy will stop you," he gasped, his voice barely a whisper.

Vargas laughed, a harsh, triumphant sound. "We'll see about that."

He raised the knife.

The blade plunged into Marco's side, just below the ribs. A searing, agonizing pain ripped through his body. He cried out, a strangled, desperate sound. He felt the warmth of his own blood spreading across his skin, soaking into his clothes.

Vargas twisted the knife, a deliberate act of cruelty. Marco’s vision swam. The world began to fade around the edges, dissolving into a swirling darkness.

Vargas yanked the knife free, the sound of it sickeningly wet. He stood there for a moment, watching Marco bleed, his expression one of cold satisfaction.

"Worthless," he spat, wiping the blade clean on Marco’s shirt. "Now, let's go find Izzy."

He turned and strode away, his men following close behind.

Marco lay on the ground, his body twitching uncontrollably. He was drowning in pain, his breath shallow and ragged. He could feel his life slipping away, seeping into the dust and rubble around him.

The last thing he saw before the darkness consumed him was the dull, grey sky, a vast and indifferent expanse above the ruined city. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was going to die here, alone and forgotten, amidst the crumbling remains of a lost civilization.

The "edge" of the Ciénaga Negra was less a defined boundary and more a gradual surrender. The dense, sun-drenched jungle slowly yielded to a realm of stagnant water, gnarled trees draped in Spanish moss, and an oppressive humidity that clung to Izzy like a second skin. The air hung heavy, thick with the smells of decay and the drone of unseen insects.

Marco moved with a practiced ease, his machete flashing occasionally to clear a hanging vine or a particularly stubborn branch. He pointed to a barely discernible track, a slight depression in the muddy ground.

"This is where we start," he said, his voice low. "Vargas's men, they'll be looking for clear signs – broken branches, footprints in open ground. They'll want the easy path." He grinned, a flash of white teeth in his tanned face. "We're not going to give them the easy path."

Izzy watched him, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. "What are you going to do?"

Marco knelt, examining the ground. "We're going to make them *think* they've found the easy path… straight into the heart of the swamp."

He began working with a deliberate, almost artistic precision. First, he used his machete to widen a small animal trail leading directly into the murky water, hacking away at the reeds and roots, making it appear well-trodden. He then carefully placed a series of deliberately broken branches, snapping them in a way that suggested a hurried passage.

"See here?" he said, pointing to a broken twig. "I snap it upwards, so it looks like someone brushed past it going *in*. And I make sure there's a clear footprint – just one, though. Too many, and they'll get suspicious."

He used the heel of his boot to create a partial print in the soft mud, then carefully obscured most of it with a handful of leaves. He repeated this process, creating a series of false trails, each one leading deeper into the swamp, each one meticulously crafted to appear genuine.

Izzy, observing his work, was impressed by his skill. "You're good at this," she admitted.

Marco shrugged, wiping sweat from his brow. "My grandfather taught me. He knew this swamp like the back of his hand. He used to say, 'The jungle can be your friend, or your enemy. It all depends on how you treat it.'"

He paused, looking out over the expanse of murky water and tangled vegetation. "Vargas's men… they don't respect the jungle. They see it as an obstacle, something to be conquered. They won't understand its secrets."

He continued his work, creating a web of deception. He even took a piece of Izzy's spare shirt, a bright blue cotton fabric, and tore off a small strip, carefully snagging it on a thorny branch deep within the swamp's edge.

"They'll find this," he said, holding it up. "They'll think you went this way. They'll follow."

Izzy shivered, despite the heat. "And then what?"

Marco's eyes were cold. "Then the swamp will take care of them. Quicksand, snakes… there are things in there that even *I* don't know about." He met her gaze. "We need to be careful, too. We'll follow the *real* trail, the one the *Gente de la Sombra* use. It's harder to find, but it's safer."

He pointed to a faint, almost invisible path that ran parallel to the swamp's edge, hidden beneath a thick layer of ferns and fallen leaves. It was barely discernible, even when he pointed it out.

"Stay close," he said. "And watch where you step."

They moved along the hidden path, the sounds of their passage muffled by the dense vegetation. The air grew heavier, the silence broken only by the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional splash of something unseen in the water. Izzy could feel the tension coiling in her muscles, a mixture of fear and a strange kind of exhilaration.

After what felt like an eternity, they heard voices. Faint at first, then growing louder. Marco stopped, holding up a hand.

"They're here," he whispered.

They crouched low, hidden behind a thick clump of mangrove roots. Izzy peered through the gaps, her heart pounding. She could see three of Vargas's men, their faces grim and determined, their weapons held ready. They were following one of the false trails Marco had created, their boots sinking into the mud.

"This way!" one of them called out, his voice echoing across the still water. "I found a piece of cloth – blue, like the woman's shirt!"

"She must have panicked," another said, his voice laced with a cruel satisfaction. "She's running blind."

They plunged deeper into the swamp, their movements becoming increasingly clumsy as the ground grew softer and more treacherous. One of them stumbled, cursing as he sank knee-deep in the muck.

Marco watched them, his face expressionless. He turned to Izzy, a flicker of grim satisfaction in his eyes.

"It worked," he whispered. "They took the bait."

Izzy nodded, a wave of relief washing over her. The deception had been successful. Vargas's men were lost in the heart of the Ciénaga Negra, while she and Marco were one step closer to the City of the Serpent God. The swamp, for now, was their ally.

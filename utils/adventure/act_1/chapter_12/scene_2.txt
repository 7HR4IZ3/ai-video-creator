The hut was stifling. The woven walls offered little ventilation, trapping the humid night air and the scent of earth and something vaguely animalistic. Izzy coughed, swatting uselessly at the darkness. “Figure something out, huh? Like what, Marco? Telepathy?”

Marco didn't answer immediately. Izzy could hear him shuffling, the rustle of the dry leaves that served as their bedding. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and thoughtful. "There's… a chance."

"A chance? A chance of what? Being rescued by a squadron of highly trained linguist monkeys?"

"No. A chance I might… understand them. A little."

Izzy snorted. "You couldn't even order a beer in Italian."

“This is different.” Marco’s voice had a newfound intensity. “My grandfather… he traveled a lot. He picked up languages like lint. He spent some time in this region, years ago. Told me stories. Showed me… things.”

"Things? What things? Charades? Marco, they're literally armed with spears."

"No, Izzy, listen. He mentioned a dialect, a very old one, spoken by some of the more isolated tribes. He said it was related to a language from Southeast Asia. I remember… snippets. Just fragments, really. But maybe…" He trailed off, his voice filled with uncertainty.

Izzy was silent for a moment, considering. "Okay," she said finally. "Okay, maybe. But what are you going to do? Shout random phrases at them until they understand? We’re locked in a hut, remember?”

“We need to get out of here first. And then… well, then I’ll try.”

A sudden commotion outside silenced them. The door flap was yanked open, flooding the hut with the flickering light of torches. The same two tribesmen who had escorted them earlier stood silhouetted against the brighter background, their faces grim.

"Showtime," Izzy muttered.

They were prodded, none too gently, out of the hut and back into the heart of the village. The entire tribe seemed to be gathered, their faces a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. The Tribal Leader sat on a raised platform, his gaze fixed on them. The air crackled with tension.

Marco took a deep breath. This was it. He focused, dredging up fragments of half-forgotten words, sounds his grandfather had uttered decades ago. He cleared his throat, and in a voice that wavered slightly, began.

"Um… *Ahm… ma…lai… to… ke*…” He winced. It sounded ridiculous, even to him. “*Kami… bukan… jahat*?”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. The Leader's expression didn't change, but Marco thought he detected a flicker of something – surprise? – in his eyes.

He pressed on, encouraged by the slight reaction. "*Kami… datang… damai…* I… we… come… peace…” he stammered, struggling with the unfamiliar sounds. He pointed to himself, then to Izzy. "*Kami… mahu… lalu… sahaja.* We… want… pass… only."

The tribesmen exchanged glances. One of them, an older man with intricate tattoos on his face, stepped forward and spoke to the Leader in rapid, guttural tones. The Leader listened intently, his face impassive.

Izzy nudged Marco. "What did you say? Did you just accidentally ask them to sell us their finest goat?"

"I think… I think I said we aren't here to hurt them, that we just want to pass through their land. But I'm not sure. It's like trying to assemble a puzzle with half the pieces missing."

The Leader raised a hand, silencing the murmurs of the tribe. He fixed Marco with a long, appraising stare. Then, slowly, deliberately, he spoke. His words were alien, but Marco thought he recognized a few of the sounds he’d just used.

"*Kamu… mahu… lalu? Mengapa?*" The Leader’s tone was sharp, questioning.

Marco hesitated. He knew he had to be careful. One wrong word, one misplaced inflection, and everything could fall apart. He closed his eyes for a moment, focusing, trying to piece together the meaning.

"*Kami… cari… jalan… ke… bandar… hilang.* We… seek… path… to… city… lost." He wasn't sure if he'd gotten it right, but it was the best he could do.

The Leader remained silent for a long moment, his gaze unwavering. The tension in the village was palpable. Izzy held her breath, her eyes darting from the Leader to the tribesmen, searching for any sign of their intentions.

Finally, the Leader spoke again, his voice softer this time, almost… curious. "*Bandar… hilang?*"

Marco nodded, relief flooding through him. He'd gotten through. He'd conveyed something, at least. "Yes," he said, carefully choosing his words. "*Bandar… lama… tersembunyi.* City… old… hidden."

The Leader looked at Marco, then at Izzy, his expression unreadable. After another beat of silence, he spoke a few words to one of his tribesmen.

The tribesman nodded and disappeared into one of the huts. He returned a moment later, carrying… a small rug. He unrolled it and laid it before the Leader. It depicted a crude map of the surrounding area, with landmarks that Marco recognized: the river, the mountains, even the swamp.

The Leader pointed to a spot on the map, far to the east. "*Bandar… itu… sana*?"

Marco followed the Leader's finger. The spot he indicated was in the heart of the jungle, deep within the uncharted territory. It was exactly where Izzy's map had placed the city.

Hope flared within him. They were getting somewhere.

The Leader looked at him again, his eyes boring into Marco's. "We will talk," he said, his voice low and serious. "But first… you will tell me why you seek this lost city."

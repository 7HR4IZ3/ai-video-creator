The stench of mildew and something vaguely reptilian hung heavy in the air. Izzy stumbled forward, her hand trailing along the damp, rough-hewn stone of the tunnel wall. Water trickled down her neck, icy and unwelcome. The tunnel was barely wide enough for her to fully extend her arms, forcing her into a hunched, awkward gait. Marco, bless his perpetually optimistic soul, kept whispering encouragement behind her.

“Almost there, Izzy. I can feel it. The air’s… different. Got a certain… ancient *je ne sais quoi*, eh?”

Izzy snorted, the sound echoing strangely in the confined space. “If ‘ancient *je ne sais quoi*’ smells like bat guano and something that died down here a century ago, then yeah, you’re spot on.”

She hadn’t seen Marco since Vargas's men had attacked them. She had no idea if he was alive and now that she had found him, she didn't want to lose him. “How are you doing?”

"I am fine, Izzy. Just a scratch." Marco said gently.

They'd been crawling, scrambling, and occasionally swimming through a network of forgotten tunnels beneath the city for what felt like an eternity. The map, or rather, the tattered fragment of a map, had led her here, promising a hidden escape route. So far, all it had delivered was dampness, the unsettling feeling of being watched, and the persistent fear of the tunnel collapsing around them.

“Remind me again why we’re trusting a map that looks like it was drawn by a drunken spider?” she muttered, her voice tight with exhaustion and a growing sense of dread.

“Because,” Marco replied, his voice losing some of its usual levity, “it’s the only lead we have. And besides, think of the alternative. Vargas and his charming crew turning us into pincushions back in the plaza.”

Izzy didn’t need reminding. The image of Rios’s lifeless body lying amidst the shattered stone was burned into her memory. Vargas was a predator, and he wouldn't hesitate to kill anyone who stood in his way.

“Just… keep your voice down,” she hissed, pausing and pressing her ear against the wall. “I think I heard something.”

Silence descended, thick and heavy. The dripping water seemed to amplify, each drop a tiny hammer blow against her nerves. Then, she heard it again – a faint shuffling sound, the unmistakable echo of footsteps behind them.

“They’re gaining on us,” she whispered, her heart pounding against her ribs. “Faster. We need to move faster.”

They pressed onward, their pace quickening, the tunnel becoming a claustrophobic nightmare. The air grew colder, the stench more acrid. The walls began to narrow, forcing them to squeeze through tight passages, scraping their skin against the rough stone.

Suddenly, the tunnel opened into a larger chamber, a circular space with a high, vaulted ceiling. A single shaft of light pierced through a crack in the ceiling, illuminating a swirling cloud of dust motes. In the center of the chamber stood a crumbling stone pedestal, and on top of it, a tarnished metal box.

“What is that?” Marco breathed, his voice hushed with awe.

Izzy ignored the box. She was too focused on the four passageways that led out of the chamber, each one disappearing into the darkness.

“We need to choose,” she said, her voice tight with urgency. “And we need to choose now.”

She scanned the passageways, her eyes darting from one to another. They all looked the same – dark, menacing, and utterly devoid of any distinguishing features.

“Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?” Marco offered, his attempt at humor falling flat.

“No time for games,” Izzy snapped, her temper fraying. “Think, Marco, think! Which way would they expect us to go?”

“Probably the most obvious one,” he replied, gesturing towards the largest of the passageways. “Vargas isn’t exactly known for his subtlety.”

“Then we go the opposite,” Izzy decided, pointing to the smallest, narrowest passage. “They’ll expect us to take the path of least resistance. We’ll give them something different.”

Without waiting for a response, she plunged into the darkness, her hand outstretched, feeling for the wall. Marco followed close behind, his breathing ragged. As they disappeared into the narrow tunnel, a faint echo of voices could be heard from the passageway they had just left, growing louder with each passing moment. Vargas was close. Very close.

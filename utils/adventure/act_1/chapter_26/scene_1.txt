The dust was a living thing, a suffocating shroud that clung to Marco's throat and stung his eyes. He coughed, hacking up a gritty phlegm as he clawed his way over another mountain of rubble. The central chamber was unrecognizable, a chaotic jumble of shattered pillars, pulverized carvings, and dust-choked air. The ornate patterns that had once adorned the walls were now just jagged edges and broken pieces underfoot.

"Izzy!" he roared, his voice hoarse and strained. The sound was swallowed by the groaning of the collapsing city, a monstrous symphony of destruction that echoed in his ears. "Izzy, can you hear me?!"

He knew it was a fool’s errand. The whole place was coming down. Vargas was probably crushed. Izzy… the thought stuck in his throat like another piece of rubble. He had to try. He owed her that much.

He scrambled down a precarious slope of debris, his boots slipping on loose stones. The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid smell of pulverized stone. He scanned the scene, his eyes desperately seeking any sign of her – a scrap of her crimson scarf, the glint of her spectacles, anything.

"Damn it, Izzy!" he shouted again, his voice cracking with desperation. He had no idea how long it had been since the collapse. Minutes? Hours? Time had become a meaningless concept, replaced by the relentless urgency of his search.

He started moving methodically, choosing a section of the chamber and beginning to clear it piece by piece. He heaved aside chunks of stone that weighed more than he did, muscles screaming in protest. He ignored the pain, fueled by a desperate hope that refused to be extinguished.

"Come on, Izzy," he muttered, his breath coming in ragged gasps. "Just… just give me something."

He dug with his hands now, fingers raw and bleeding from contact with the sharp edges of the debris. He imagined her trapped beneath this mountain of stone, struggling for air, her quick wit and fiery spirit slowly being snuffed out. The image spurred him on, adrenaline coursing through his veins.

He unearthed a section of intricately carved frieze, depicting some long-forgotten deity. He hurled it aside with a grunt. Then, he saw it. A flash of color beneath a pile of smaller stones – crimson, unmistakable.

His heart leaped into his throat. He threw himself at the pile, tearing at the rocks with renewed fervor. Dust billowed around him, choking him, blinding him, but he didn't stop. He pulled away a larger stone, then another, and another, revealing…

Izzy.

She was lying on her side, half-buried in the rubble, her face pale and streaked with dust. One arm was pinned beneath a large stone, her leg twisted at an unnatural angle. Her spectacles were gone, and a trickle of blood ran from her temple.

For a moment, Marco froze, his heart hammering in his chest. She looked so fragile, so still. He reached out a trembling hand and touched her cheek.

"Izzy?" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Her eyelids flickered. She groaned softly, her lips parting slightly.

"Marco…?" she mumbled, her voice weak and raspy.

Relief washed over him in a tidal wave, so intense it almost brought him to his knees. She was alive. She was actually alive.

"I'm here, Izzy," he said, his voice thick with emotion. "I'm here. Just hang on."

He assessed the situation quickly. The stone pinning her arm was too heavy to lift on his own. He needed leverage. Scrambling around, he found a relatively intact piece of the broken pillar nearby. He jammed one end beneath the stone and, using all his strength, heaved upwards.

The stone shifted slightly. He strained, grunting with effort, and pushed harder. The stone moved enough for him to pull her arm free.

"Easy, Izzy," he said, his voice strained. "Almost there."

With her arm free, he carefully began pulling her from the rubble, mindful of her injured leg. She groaned again, her eyes fluttering open.

"What… what happened?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

"The city happened," Marco said grimly. "Just hold still."

He finally managed to pull her clear of the debris. He cradled her in his arms, his heart pounding in his chest. She was battered and bruised, but she was alive.

"You idiot," she mumbled, a faint smile playing on her lips. "I thought you were dead."

"Not today," Marco said, returning her smile. "Not today."

He knew they weren’t out of the woods yet. The city was still collapsing, and they needed to get out of here, fast. But for now, in this moment, all that mattered was that Izzy was alive. He lifted her carefully, ignoring the pain in his own body, and started to move, searching for a path through the ruins, determined to get them both out of this crumbling tomb.

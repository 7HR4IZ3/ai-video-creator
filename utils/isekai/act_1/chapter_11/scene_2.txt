The throbbing alarm intensified, vibrating in Mara’s chest. The red light cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile white walls of the Virus Storage Room. Kenji gripped the datapad tighter, his knuckles white.

“This way!” he barked, already moving towards the far end of the room.

Mara followed, her senses on high alert. The air felt thick, heavy with the threat of unseen dangers. The room was enormous, a cavernous space filled with row upon row of cylindrical containers, each labeled with cryptic codes and biohazard symbols. The smooth, polished surfaces reflected the pulsing red light, creating a dizzying, disorienting effect.

“What *is* this place?” Mara asked, her voice tight with urgency.

“The heart of the beast,” Kenji replied, his eyes scanning the rows of canisters. “This is where they’re storing the virus. Look!”

He pointed towards a section of the room dominated by a large, glass-walled chamber. Inside, a complex array of machinery hummed and whirred. Tubes snaked across the walls, connecting to a central containment unit.

“A testing chamber,” Mara breathed, recognizing the apparatus. “They’re experimenting on live subjects.”

Kenji cursed under his breath. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

But Mara stood frozen, her gaze fixed on the chamber. "Wait," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "If we’re going to stop this thing, we need to know what we're dealing with."

Kenji stopped, his expression a mixture of frustration and concern. “And how do you propose we do that? Walk in there and ask nicely?”

“We need a sample,” Mara stated, her eyes hardening with determination. “A small one. Enough to analyze.”

“Are you insane?” Kenji exploded, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “This is a biohazard level four facility! We don’t have the proper equipment! We’ll be contaminated before we even get close!”

“Then we improvise,” Mara retorted, already moving towards the canisters. “What other choice do we have? We can’t just run and hope someone else figures it out. We saw what this thing can do.”

Kenji grabbed her arm, stopping her in her tracks. “Mara, listen to me. This is suicide. We don’t even know what precautions they’ve taken! There could be sensors, automated defenses…”

“And if we don’t do something, everyone we know will be under Kaiba Corp's control,” Mara countered, pulling her arm free. “Is that what you want?”

Kenji hesitated, his jaw clenched. He knew she was right, but the risk was terrifying. The throbbing alarm seemed to mock him, counting down the seconds until their inevitable capture.

"There!" Mara exclaimed, pointing to a small, unlabeled canister near the back of the rows. "It's isolated from the others, almost like it's a control sample."

She pulled a small, sterile vial from her pocket – one she’d swiped from the maintenance cart earlier. “We’ll need to be quick.”

Kenji sighed, the fight draining out of him. He knew he couldn’t change her mind. He just hoped he could keep her alive.

"Alright," he said, his voice resigned. "I'll cover you. But one drop, Mara. That’s all we need. And if anything goes wrong, we abort. Understood?"

Mara nodded, her focus laser-sharp. She approached the canister cautiously, her movements slow and deliberate. She noticed a small access port on the side, sealed with a thin membrane.

“I’m going to puncture the membrane,” she said, her voice barely audible. “Stand back.”

Kenji positioned himself near the entrance, his eyes darting around the room, searching for any sign of movement. He drew the stunner he had taken from the guard, his hand steady despite the pounding of his heart.

Mara took a deep breath and carefully inserted the tip of the vial into the access port. She pressed gently, feeling the membrane give way with a soft *pop*. A faint, almost imperceptible wisp of vapor escaped, and she quickly tilted the vial to collect a single droplet.

As she withdrew the vial, a high-pitched whine filled the room. A laser grid shimmered into existence, blocking their path to the exit.

“Damn it!” Kenji yelled. “They’re locking us down!”

Mara capped the vial, her hands shaking. “I got the sample. Let’s go!”

They turned and sprinted towards the opposite side of the room, hoping to find another way out. The alarm intensified, its throbbing rhythm a relentless reminder of the danger they were in. They secured a small sample of the virus, knowing it's the only way to analyze and potentially counteract it.

The grimy floor of the netrunner den rushed up to meet Mara as her knees buckled. The fragmented map swam before her eyes, morphing into a kaleidoscope of meaningless color before dissolving into blackness.

"Mara!" Kenji's voice was a panicked shout as he caught her before she hit the ground completely. He lowered her gently, her body limp in his arms.

"Mara, talk to me!" He slapped her cheek lightly, his voice laced with worry. Her eyelids fluttered, and she groaned softly.

"Too much…data," she mumbled, her voice barely audible. "Overload."

Kenji cursed under his breath. He should have pulled her out sooner. He grabbed a grimy rag from a nearby table and soaked it with water from a rusty pipe. He wrung it out and gently dabbed her forehead.

The den, which had seemed merely dingy moments ago, now felt suffocatingly filthy. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic vipers, and the air hung thick with the smell of burnt electronics and desperation. It was far from an ideal place for someone in her condition.

"Stay still," he ordered, his tone softening. "I'll get you something."

He rummaged through his bag, pulling out a nutrient bar and a small vial of revitalizing serum. He cracked the vial open and held it to her lips.

"Drink," he urged. "Slowly."

Mara grimaced at the metallic taste but swallowed obediently. The serum coursed through her veins, bringing a faint flush back to her pale face.

"Thanks," she whispered, her eyes fluttering open. "Should have…paced myself."

"Pacing wasn't exactly an option, was it?" Kenji retorted, his voice still sharp with concern. "That firewall was about to fry Kai's brain. You pushed yourself too hard."

He helped her sit up, propping her against the wall. Her breathing was still shallow, her face still pale, but the shaking had subsided.

"I had to get the location," she insisted, her voice stronger now. "We're running out of time."

"And what good are you to anyone if you're burnt out?" Kenji snapped, his frustration bubbling to the surface. "You're not a machine, Mara. You have limits."

"Tell that to Kaiba Corp," she shot back, her eyes flashing. "They don't care about limits. They're about to unleash a virus that rewrites people's minds. I had to get that location, Kenji! It's the only way to stop them."

Kenji ran a hand through his hair, his anger fading, replaced by guilt. He knew she was right. He just hated seeing her like this, so vulnerable.

"I know, I know," he sighed, kneeling in front of her. "You're right. But you scared me. You were out for a minute there."

He examined her face, searching for any signs of lasting damage. Her eyes were clear, though still tired, and her breathing was becoming more regular.

"Okay," he said, standing up. "Let's see what you got."

He went to the console and brought up the fragmented images. He frowned at the blurry, distorted pictures.

"This is a mess," he commented. "But I can work with it."

Mara pushed herself up from the wall, wincing slightly. "Sublevel 7. Deep under the main complex. Heavily guarded."

"Yeah, I see that," Kenji muttered, zooming in on a particular section of the map. "Laser grids, pressure sensors, motion detectors…they're not messing around."

He worked silently for a few minutes, enhancing the images, piecing together the fragments. His fingers flew across the keyboard as he traced the corridors and identified the security checkpoints.

"There's a service entrance on the east side," he said finally, pointing to a small, barely visible passage on the map. "It's less heavily guarded than the main entrances, but it's still going to be a challenge."

Mara leaned over his shoulder, studying the map. "That might be our best bet. But we'll need a disguise. Something to get us past the security checkpoints."

"I have an idea," Kenji said, a glint in his eye. "Remember those maintenance worker uniforms we lifted from the laundry the other day?"

Mara nodded slowly. "Yeah…they're a little big on me, but they might work."

"We can make them work," Kenji said, his determination returning. "But first, you need to rest. We're not going anywhere until you're back on your feet."

"We don't have time to rest, Kenji," Mara protested, her voice rising. "Every minute counts."

"And we're not going to get anywhere if you collapse halfway through," Kenji countered, his voice firm. "We need you at your best. So, rest. I'll study the map, plan our route. We leave in six hours."

Mara opened her mouth to argue, but the exhaustion washed over her again, silencing her protests. She knew he was right. She needed to recharge, to gather her strength.

"Okay," she said finally, her voice barely a whisper. "Six hours."

Kenji helped her over to a grimy cot in the corner of the den. He covered her with a tattered blanket and stood there for a moment, watching her.

"Get some sleep, Mara," he said softly. "We'll be ready."

He turned and went back to the console, his brow furrowed in concentration. Six hours. It wasn't much time, but it was all they had. He had to make sure they were ready. He had to make sure Mara was ready. The fate of the city might depend on it.

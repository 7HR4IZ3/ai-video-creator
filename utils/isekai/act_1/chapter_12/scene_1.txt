The moment the laser grid snapped into existence, painting the sterile white walls with crimson bars, the silence shattered. A klaxon wailed, a piercing, insistent shriek designed to induce panic. Mara’s adrenaline spiked.

“This way!” Kenji bellowed over the din, already sprinting towards a service hatch they'd noticed earlier, tucked away behind a towering stack of data servers.

Mara, clutching the vial like a lifeline, pounded after him. “Did you see any cameras?” she yelled.

“Everywhere!” Kenji shouted back, his face grim. “This place is crawling with them!”

They reached the hatch, a square metal panel set flush into the wall. Kenji wrestled with the release, his fingers fumbling in his haste. “Locked!” he cursed, slamming his fist against the metal.

Behind them, the *thump-thump* of heavy boots echoed down the corridor. “They’re coming!” Mara yelled, her voice tight with fear.

Kenji drew his stunner and blasted the locking mechanism. Sparks flew, and the panel popped open with a groan. He yanked it free, revealing a narrow access tunnel filled with a tangle of wires and pipes.

“Ladies first,” he said, gesturing into the claustrophobic space.

Mara didn't hesitate. She squeezed through the opening, scraping her elbow against the rough metal. “It’s tight!” she called back.

Kenji followed, barely managing to wedge his broader frame through the gap. The hatch clanged shut behind him, plunging them into near-total darkness, the alarm a muffled, throbbing pulse.

“Which way?” Mara asked, feeling around in the darkness. The air was thick with dust and the metallic tang of ozone.

“Doesn’t matter,” Kenji said, his voice strained. “Just keep moving.”

They crawled forward, their progress agonizingly slow. Wires snagged on their clothes, and sharp edges dug into their knees. The relentless alarm pounded in Mara’s head, amplifying her fear.

Suddenly, a voice boomed from a speaker hidden somewhere in the tunnel. “Intruders detected in Sector 7. All security personnel, converge on access point Alpha-Nine. I repeat, intruders detected…”

“They know where we are!” Mara hissed.

“Faster!” Kenji urged, pushing past her.

They rounded a bend in the tunnel and saw a faint glimmer of light ahead. Hope surged through Mara. An exit! But as they drew closer, they heard voices.

“They have to come out here,” one voice said. “Seal it off.”

“Roger that,” another replied.

Mara exchanged a panicked glance with Kenji. They were trapped.

He pulled her back into the shadows. “Plan B,” he muttered, his face illuminated by the faint light filtering through the grate at the end of the tunnel. “We fight.”

They crept closer to the grate, peering through the narrow openings. They were in a maintenance corridor, and two security guards in full riot gear stood blocking the exit. They were armed with pulse rifles, their faces hidden behind visors.

“Ready?” Kenji whispered.

Mara took a deep breath, steeling herself. “Let’s do it.”

Kenji kicked out the grate, sending it clattering onto the floor. The guards spun around, their rifles raised. Kenji fired his stunner, hitting one guard square in the chest. He crumpled to the ground, twitching.

The other guard raised his rifle, but Mara was already moving. She threw herself at him, knocking the rifle off target. It discharged, sending a bolt of energy searing a hole in the ceiling.

The guard staggered, trying to regain his balance. Mara grabbed his wrist and twisted, forcing him to drop the rifle. He roared in pain and tried to grab her, but she ducked under his arm and slammed her fist into his jaw. He went down hard.

“Go!” Kenji yelled, already moving towards the downed guards.

Mara scrambled over the unconscious bodies and into the corridor. She didn’t stop to check if they were alive. She just ran, her heart pounding in her chest.

The corridor was a maze of identical doors and flickering fluorescent lights. She could hear the sound of more guards approaching, their heavy boots drumming on the metal floor.

She spotted an elevator at the end of the corridor and sprinted towards it. The doors were opening, revealing an empty car. She dove inside and frantically stabbed at the button for the ground floor.

As the doors began to close, she saw Kenji burst into the corridor, two security guards hot on his heels. He fired his stunner again, slowing them down, but they were still closing in.

“Kenji! Jump!” Mara yelled.

He leaped, throwing himself into the closing doors. They slammed shut on his arm, momentarily trapping him. He grunted in pain, but managed to wrench himself free and stumble into the elevator.

The doors closed, and the elevator began to descend. Mara and Kenji leaned against the wall, gasping for breath.

“That was close,” Kenji said, rubbing his arm.

Suddenly, the elevator lurched to a halt. The lights flickered and died, plunging them into darkness.

“What now?” Mara groaned.

Then, they heard it. A low, guttural growl, coming from somewhere above them. Something was in the elevator shaft. And it was coming down.

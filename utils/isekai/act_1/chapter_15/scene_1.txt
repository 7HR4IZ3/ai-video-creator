The world was white. Blinding, sterile white. Mara blinked, trying to focus, but her vision swam. A throbbing ache pulsed behind her eyes, a relentless drumbeat of pain that resonated with the frantic hammering of her heart. She was strapped to a chair, cold metal biting into her wrists and ankles. The smooth, unforgiving surface pressed against her back, offering no comfort, only a chilling reminder of her helplessness.

The room was circular, devoid of any discernible features save for the chair and the two figures flanking a man in a spotless white coat. The white coat belonged to the Doctor. The two figures were Kaiba Corp Agents. They were both tall, imposing shapes dressed in the uniform of the corporation enforcers: black, utilitarian, and utterly devoid of personality. They stood like silent sentinels.

The Doctor smiled, a thin, professional smile that didn’t reach his eyes. His eyes were cold, calculating, and devoid of empathy. He held a clipboard in his hand and tapped it lightly against his thigh.

“Good morning, Mara,” he said, his voice a smooth, almost soothing baritone. “Or should I say, good afternoon? Time tends to lose its meaning in here.”

Mara strained against the restraints, her muscles screaming in protest. "Let me go! What is this? What do you want?"

The Doctor chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. “Now, now, Mara. No need to get agitated. We’re only here to help you. You have some…unnecessary memories cluttering your mind. Memories that are holding you back from achieving your full potential.”

"Unnecessary?" Mara spat, her voice trembling with fear and anger. "They're *my* memories! You have no right!"

The Doctor sighed, a theatrical gesture of patience. "Think of it as… spring cleaning for the mind. We're simply tidying up, removing the… debris. You’ll feel so much clearer afterward. More focused. More… compliant." He glanced at the Agents, who remained impassive, their faces masks of cold indifference.

"Compliant?" Mara repeated, her voice rising in panic. "You're going to brainwash me? I won't let you!" She thrashed against the restraints again, the metal digging deeper into her skin.

"Unfortunately, Mara, you don't have a choice," the Doctor said, his voice hardening. “We’re not asking for your permission. We are following orders.” He nodded to one of the Agents who stepped forward, holding a syringe filled with a viscous, luminescent fluid.

"No! Get away from me!" Mara screamed, tears welling up in her eyes. "What is that? What are you going to do to me?"

"Just a little something to… relax you," the Doctor said, his smile returning. "It will help ease the transition." He reached out and gently tilted her head to the side, exposing the delicate skin of her neck.

Mara struggled with renewed vigor, twisting and turning, desperate to escape. "Please! Don't do this! I haven't done anything wrong!"

The Agent expertly swabbed her neck with alcohol. The cold sting was a stark contrast to the burning terror that consumed her.

“We know you haven’t done anything wrong, Mara,” the Doctor said, his voice almost gentle. “That’s why we’re doing this. To ensure you *never* do anything wrong. To make you… perfect.”

The needle pierced her skin. A jolt of icy fire shot through her veins, radiating outward from the point of entry. Mara gasped, her body convulsing. Her vision blurred, the white room swirling around her.

"What... what is this doing to me?" She choked out, her voice barely a whisper.

"It's erasing," the Doctor said, his voice now a detached, clinical monotone. "It's delicately unraveling the threads of your past, removing the unwanted memories, the… imperfections. Starting with the most recent, working our way back. Don't worry, we'll leave the important things. Your name, your basic skills… enough to function in society. Just not enough to question it."

The pain intensified, a searing agony that ripped through her mind. Images flickered before her eyes, fragmented and distorted. Faces she knew, places she had been, events she had experienced, all dissolving into a chaotic jumble of light and shadow.

She saw her mother’s face, smiling, then fading into static. She remembered laughter, the warmth of sunlight on her skin, the taste of rain, all slipping away like grains of sand through her fingers.

"Stop! Please, stop!" She begged, her voice hoarse and broken. "You're killing me!"

The Doctor didn't answer. He simply watched, his eyes cold and detached, as the life drained from her eyes.

"Initializing memory block," the Doctor stated, glancing at the monitors. “Targeting sequence complete.”

Mara's screams became strangled whimpers. The pain was unbearable, a white-hot fire burning away everything that made her who she was. She felt herself slipping away, losing her grip on reality, dissolving into nothingness.

A single image remained clear, burning in her mind's eye: a face, younger, harder, someone she knew but couldn’t quite place. He was watching her, his expression unreadable, a flicker of something that might have been pity in his eyes. Kaito. That was the name that echoed in her pain filled mind.

“Memory revision in progress,” the Doctor announced. The sound was like thunder in her head.

Then, darkness.

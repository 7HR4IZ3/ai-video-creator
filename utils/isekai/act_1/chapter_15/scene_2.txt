Mara gasped, her body convulsing as she slammed back into the cold reality of the safehouse. Her chest heaved, each breath a ragged, desperate fight for air. The sterile, metallic tang of fear coated her tongue. She was sprawled on the worn, stained mattress, the dampness of sweat clinging to her skin.

Kenji was there, kneeling beside her, his face a mask of concern. "Mara! Mara, you okay? What happened?" His hand hovered tentatively over her arm, unsure if he should touch her.

She flinched away from him, recoiling as if burned. The images – the sterile white room, the cold, detached doctor, the *erasing* – were still vivid, clawing at the edges of her sanity.

"Don't...don't touch me," she rasped, her voice a raw whisper. She squeezed her eyes shut, fighting back the wave of nausea that threatened to overwhelm her.

"Easy, Mara," Kenji soothed, his voice low and calming. "Just breathe. You were out of it for a minute there. Like…like you were reliving something bad."

Reliving? It felt like she *had* lived it. The feeling was so real, so visceral, that she wasn't sure what to believe anymore. Her own memories felt tainted, unreliable.

Sato remained standing a few feet away, leaning against the far wall. He watched with an unnerving stillness, his expression unreadable in the dim, flickering light of the single overhead bulb. He hadn’t moved during the entire ordeal, only looked on like a silent observer.

Mara forced herself to sit up, her head swimming. "What...what was that?" she asked, her voice trembling. She looked at Kenji, pleading for an explanation, for reassurance.

Kenji shook his head, his brow furrowed. "I don't know. One minute you were fine, the next you just...froze. Started shaking. It was like you were having a seizure, but..." He trailed off, unable to articulate what he had witnessed.

Her gaze flickered to Sato, a desperate plea for understanding in her eyes. "Sato, what's going on? What did you do to me?"

Sato pushed himself off the wall, his movements fluid and predatory. "I did nothing, Mara. You experienced a flashback. A memory resurfacing. It appears Project Chimera triggered something within you."

"Project Chimera?" She repeated, the words heavy with dread.

"The memory rewriting program at Kaiba Corp," Sato explained, his voice carefully neutral. "It appears you have…unpleasant associations with memory manipulation."

Unpleasant? It was torture. It was having her very self ripped away, piece by piece. And the face...Kaito's face, watching her. What did it mean?

"Who…who is Kaito?" she asked, the name a foreign weight on her tongue.

Sato paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. "Kaito Ishikawa. My second in command. Why do you ask?"

Kenji shot Sato a wary glance. "Maybe we should slow down. Mara's clearly not in a good place right now."

"There isn't time for that," Sato retorted, his voice hardening. "The virus is spreading. We need to synthesize the cure, and to do that, we need the sample." He turned his gaze back to Mara, his eyes piercing and intense. "Now, Mara. The sample."

The memory of the white room, the erasing, the sheer violation, surged back with renewed force. A wave of panic washed over her, threatening to drown her in its icy grip. She couldn’t shake the feeling that Sato was somehow connected to all of it. That he knew more than he was letting on.

"Why?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. "Why is this happening to me?"

Sato sighed, a sound of forced patience. "That is not important right now. What is important is stopping the virus. People are dying, Mara."

"And you can stop it?" she pressed, her eyes searching his. "You can really stop it?"

"I can," Sato said with conviction. "But only with the sample. You have it, Mara. Use your instincts, use your brain, and focus. What do you want to do, save the world or wallow?"

Her gaze flickered to the bag at her feet, the one containing the vial of the virus. The vial that held the key to saving countless lives. But could she trust Sato? He had lied to her before, withheld information. What if this was another manipulation?

But what choice did she have? The city was descending into chaos. People were dying.

She reached for the bag, her hand trembling. The fate of the city, perhaps the world, rested on her decision. And the memory of Kaito, watching her as her identity was erased, burned in her mind. Was Sato somehow connected to that memory, to that betrayal?

The air in the room crackled with tension. Kenji watched them both, his face etched with concern. Sato’s gaze was unwavering, fixed on Mara’s face.

With a shaky breath, Mara pulled the vial from the bag, holding it up to the dim light. The liquid inside shimmered, a dark and dangerous secret.

"Here," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "Take it."

She extended her hand, offering the vial to Sato. The fate of the world, and perhaps her own sanity, hung in the balance.

The debriefing room had been sterile white, all sharp angles and emotionless chrome. Mara had answered Sato's questions with clipped precision, revealing nothing of her growing unease. She’d even managed a convincing smile when he’d congratulated her on her “impressive display of skill.” The moment she was dismissed, she booked it.

It was now 3:00 AM. The Kaiba Corp building hummed with a low, constant thrum, almost imperceptible, like a sleeping giant. Mara had spent the last few hours memorizing schematics, tracing ventilation shafts, and disabling security cameras. Now, draped in shadows like a phantom, she stood before the heavy steel door of the server room. The door was supposed to be locked, but Mara had dealt with that hours ago.

Inside, the air was frigid, thick with the metallic tang of ozone. Racks of servers blinked and whirred, their LED lights painting the room in an otherworldly glow. The noise was deafening, a constant drone that vibrated in her bones. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, minimalist offices upstairs. This felt like the engine room of something vast and unknowable.

Mara moved with practiced efficiency, bypassing the main terminals – too obvious, too monitored. She was hunting for something specific: a hidden console, a back door. Sato was a meticulous man, obsessive even. He wouldn’t leave sensitive data lying around. He’d hide it.

She found it tucked away in a far corner, behind a cluster of cooling units that blasted icy air. It was an older model, almost archaic, its screen displaying a command-line interface that looked like something out of a history museum. Perfect. No one would think to look here.

Mara plugged in her data chip, a custom-built device loaded with intrusion software. The screen flickered, and a string of code scrolled across the display. She typed in a series of commands, her fingers flying across the keyboard. The system responded sluggishly, its processing power a fraction of what the main servers boasted.

"Come on, grandpa," she muttered, "don't fail me now."

After a tense five minutes, the screen displayed a directory listing: Documents, Programs, Logs. Mara navigated to the Documents folder. The file names were cryptic, mostly meaningless strings of numbers and letters. This was going to be a slog.

She opened each file one by one, scanning for anything that stood out. Most were mundane: budget reports, system updates, meeting minutes. Then, she found it. A file named "C.P. Manifest."

Mara double-clicked. A window popped up, demanding a password.

"Damn it," she hissed. Sato had anticipated her.

She tried a few obvious guesses: his birthday, his wife's name, the company's founding date. No luck. The system locked her out after three attempts.

"Okay, plan B," she muttered. She activated a brute-force algorithm on her data chip, designed to crack passwords. It would take time, but she had no other choice.

While the program ran, she continued to explore the other files in the directory. She found more encrypted files, all with similar cryptic names. It was clear that Sato was hiding something big.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the password cracker succeeded. The "C.P. Manifest" file opened, revealing a block of encrypted text.

"What the hell is this?" Mara muttered.

The encryption was complex, unlike anything she'd seen before. It wasn't standard AES or RSA. This was something custom-built, something sophisticated. Cracking this would take days, maybe weeks. She didn't have that kind of time.

Despite not understanding it, she copied the file, along with the other encrypted documents, to her data chip. She also copied the password-protected manifest file. She might not be able to read them now, but she could analyze them later, back in her own lab.

"Alright, Sato," she whispered. "Let's see what you're really up to."

As she was about to leave, a line of text on the screen caught her eye. Buried within a system log, she saw it: "Project Chimera - Initiated."

The phrase sent a chill down her spine. It sounded… ominous.

She copied the log file to her data chip, then disconnected it from the console. As she backed away, she noticed something else: a small, almost imperceptible camera hidden in the corner of the room, pointed directly at the hidden terminal.

Sato knew she had to be here. He had been tracking her all along. He was letting her find these files.

Mara fought back a surge of panic. He was playing a game, and she was just a pawn. But she refused to be a passive victim. She would find out what Project Chimera was, and she would use it against him.

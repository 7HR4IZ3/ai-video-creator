The alley reeked, a potent cocktail of stale ramen, leaking synth-oil, and something vaguely…organic. Mara pressed herself deeper into the shadowed recess between a towering stack of discarded delivery crates and a graffiti-laden wall, her chest heaving. The rain, which had been a relentless downpour moments ago, had tapered off to a dismal drizzle, doing little to alleviate the clammy sweat clinging to her skin.

She hadn’t stopped running until her lungs screamed for air and her legs felt like jelly. The sound of that gunshot…it echoed in her mind, a sharp, brutal punctuation mark at the end of Kenji’s life. She squeezed her eyes shut, a fresh wave of grief threatening to overwhelm her. *Don’t,* she told herself fiercely. *Don’t fall apart. Not now.*

She risked a peek around the edge of the crates. The alley opened onto a side street, a chaotic blur of speeding hovercars and flickering holographic advertisements for discount cybernetics. No sign of the men in black. Not yet, anyway.

*Men in Black.* It sounded like something out of a cheap holo-flick, not a description of the ruthless bastards who had just murdered Kenji. They weren’t cops, not with those weapons, those tactics. And they clearly wanted the data-slate. Who were they, and why were they so desperate to silence her?

She pulled the slate from her jacket, its smooth surface cold against her trembling fingers. Sato. It all came back to Sato. He’d hired her, knowing full well what was on that slate, knowing she’d be walking into a hornet’s nest. He’d deliberately withheld information, practically sending her to her death.

Rage, hot and blinding, surged through her, momentarily eclipsing the grief and fear. She wanted to find Sato, to look him in the eye and ask him *why*. But she knew that wouldn’t accomplish anything. Sato was powerful, connected. She was just a data runner, a ghost in the machine.

A sudden scraping sound nearby sent her heart leaping into her throat. She whipped around, her eyes scanning the darkness. A mangy cyber-rat, its metal tail twitching, scurried across the alley floor, disappearing into a pile of discarded noodle boxes.

Mara let out a shaky breath, trying to calm her racing pulse. She couldn't afford to be this jumpy. She needed to think, to plan. But her mind was a tangled mess of fear and anger. She had to get somewhere safe, somewhere she could analyze the data-slate without looking over her shoulder every second.

"Lost, little sparrow?"

The voice, low and gravelly, sent a shiver down Mara's spine. It came from behind her, from the deepest shadows of the alley. She whirled around, her hand instinctively reaching for the small stunner she kept tucked in her boot.

A figure emerged from the darkness, a silhouette against the faint glow of a distant neon sign. He was tall and lean, wrapped in a long, tattered coat that concealed most of his features. His face was hidden beneath the wide brim of a battered hat. He looked like he'd been born and raised in this very alley.

"Who are you?" Mara demanded, her voice trembling despite her best efforts.

The figure chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "Just an observer. A fellow traveler, perhaps. I saw what happened back there. Not a pretty sight."

Mara's grip tightened on the stunner. "Stay back. I don't want any trouble."

"Trouble finds you, little sparrow," the figure said, his voice surprisingly gentle. "Especially when you're carrying something someone wants very badly."

He knew about the slate. That meant he couldn’t be trusted. "What do you want?"

"Information," he said, stepping closer. Mara tensed, ready to fire the stunner. "And perhaps…to offer some assistance."

"Assistance?" Mara scoffed. "You expect me to believe that? You're probably one of them."

"One of *them*?" The figure tilted his head, a hint of amusement in his voice. "The tailored suits? The shiny toys? Hardly. I’m just a survivor, same as you. I know this city like the back of my hand. I know who pulls the strings, and who gets used."

"And you expect me to trust you?"

"No," he said, stopping a few feet away. "I expect you to be smart. You’re out of your depth, little sparrow. Those men…they aren’t going to stop. They’ll hunt you down, tear this city apart to find you. You can't fight them alone."

The fear, which she had been trying so hard to suppress, threatened to overwhelm her again. He was right. She was alone, hunted, and she had no idea who she could trust. Maybe this mysterious figure was dangerous, but maybe he was her only chance.

"What kind of assistance are you talking about?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

The figure smiled, a flash of white teeth in the darkness. "Let’s just say I know a few places where you can disappear for a while. Places where even *they* won’t find you. And I know people who can help you understand what you're carrying. But first, you need to tell me…what did you see?"

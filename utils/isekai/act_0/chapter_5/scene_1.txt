The bell above the cafe door *dinged* as Mara and Kenji stepped out onto the rain-slicked street. The neon glow of Neo-Kyoto painted the puddles in vibrant hues, a stark contrast to the grim determination etched on their faces. Mara pulled her collar up, the chill seeping into her bones despite the humid air.

"Alright, safe house is about ten blocks from here," Kenji said, scanning the street with practiced paranoia. "We'll take the back alleys. Less chance of running into… unwanted company."

Mara nodded, her hand instinctively reaching for the data-slate tucked inside her jacket. The schematic of Sato's virus pulsed on the screen, a constant reminder of the danger they were in.

They had taken no more than a dozen steps when a sleek, black sedan screeched to a halt in front of them, blocking their path. The doors swung open with unsettling precision, and two figures emerged, their faces obscured by identical mirrored sunglasses and grim expressions. They were clad in flawlessly tailored black suits, the kind that whispered of power and corporate expense accounts. Mara recognized them instantly.

"MIB," Kenji hissed, shoving Mara behind him. "Run, Mara! Now!"

The MIB agents didn't bother with introductions. The first one, a hulking figure with a shaved head and a neck thicker than Mara's thigh, moved with surprising speed. He lunged at Kenji, a metallic glint flashing in his hand. It was a taser, modified for maximum voltage.

Kenji sidestepped the attack with a fluidity that belied his slightly rumpled appearance. He wasn't just some data runner; he knew how to fight. He grabbed the agent's wrist, twisting it with brutal efficiency. The agent grunted, the taser clattering to the ground.

"Mara, go!" Kenji yelled, his voice strained. "I'll hold them off!"

Mara hesitated, guilt twisting in her gut. She couldn't just leave him. But she also knew that arguing would only waste time. She had the data, the key to stopping Sato. Her escape was the priority.

The second MIB agent, a wiry woman with a severe haircut and eyes that seemed to dissect Mara with cold calculation, moved to intercept. Mara reacted instinctively, swinging her bag with all her might. The bag connected with the woman's temple, a sickening thud echoing in the narrow street. The agent stumbled back, momentarily stunned.

Mara didn't wait. She sprinted down the alley, the rain plastering her hair to her face. The sounds of the fight – grunts, shouts, the sickening crack of bone – spurred her on. She risked a glance over her shoulder.

Kenji was fighting both agents now, a whirlwind of desperate energy. He landed a solid punch on the woman's jaw, sending her sprawling against a dumpster. The larger agent, however, was gaining the upper hand. He grabbed Kenji in a bear hug, squeezing the air from his lungs.

"Mara, get out of here!" Kenji gasped, his face contorted with pain. "Don't… look back!"

Tears streamed down Mara's face, mingling with the rain. She knew what Kenji was doing. He was buying her time, sacrificing himself. She couldn't bear to watch.

She turned and ran, her feet pounding against the slick pavement. The alley twisted and turned, a labyrinth of garbage bins and flickering neon signs. She could still hear the sounds of the fight, but they were fading, replaced by the pounding of her own heart.

Suddenly, a deafening crack echoed through the alley, followed by an unnatural silence. Mara stopped, her breath catching in her throat. She knew what that sound was. A silenced pistol. Someone had just been shot.

She wanted to go back, to help Kenji, but she knew it was too late. He was gone. He had given his life for her, for Neo-Kyoto. The weight of his sacrifice settled on her shoulders, heavy and suffocating.

She stumbled forward, her legs leaden. The safe house seemed miles away, a distant beacon in the overwhelming darkness. She was alone now, hunted and vulnerable. But she also carried a responsibility, a debt she could never repay. She had to stop Sato. She had to avenge Kenji.

As she ran, Mara clutched the data-slate tighter, her knuckles white. The rain continued to fall, washing away the blood and the tears, but nothing could wash away the image of Kenji's face, his final act of selfless courage. The positive story value of knowing she could trust him was overwhelmed by the negative value of his loss. She would not let his sacrifice be in vain. She would make Sato pay.

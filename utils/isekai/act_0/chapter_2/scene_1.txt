The oppressive neon glow of Neo-Kyoto seeped through the panoramic windows of Sato’s office, painting the room in hues of electric blue and toxic green. It was 9:00 AM, an hour later than Sato had specified. Mara had deliberately arrived late, a small act of defiance against the unease that had settled in her stomach like a lead weight.

Sato was already at his desk, the same antique monstrosity from yesterday, now cluttered with datapads and stacks of what looked like neural interface cables. He didn’t acknowledge her entrance, his attention glued to a complex schematic shimmering on a holographic display.

Mara stood awkwardly by the door, the plush carpet muffling the sound of her boots. The opulent surroundings, which had initially impressed her, now felt suffocating, like a gilded cage. She scanned the room, searching for clues, for anything that might shed light on the mysterious task she had agreed to undertake.

Finally, Sato looked up, his expression unreadable. “You’re late, Ms. Kusanagi.”

“Traffic,” Mara lied smoothly. “The mag-lev was down.”

Sato raised a skeptical eyebrow but didn’t press the issue. “Very well. Let us begin.” He gestured towards a sleek, chrome chair positioned in front of a smaller, utilitarian desk. “Take a seat. I will explain the… basics.”

Mara sat, her back ramrod straight. The chair molded uncomfortably to her form, a subtle reminder that she didn't quite belong here. She waited, her gaze fixed on Sato, trying to gauge his true intentions.

Sato steepled his fingers, his eyes narrowed. “As I mentioned yesterday, the work you will be doing is… sensitive. It involves the retrieval and analysis of information. Specifically, information extracted from the human mind.”

Mara frowned. “You’re talking about memory extraction?”

“Essentially, yes,” Sato replied, his voice carefully measured. “But it is a far more nuanced and complex process than simply ‘extracting memories.’ You will be working with individuals who have… suppressed or fragmented recollections. Your role will be to piece together these fragments, to identify key information, and to deliver it to us.”

“And how do I do that?” Mara asked, her voice sharp. “Yesterday you said you would provide training and support, but you haven't told me anything concrete.”

Sato leaned back in his chair, a hint of amusement flickering across his lips. “Patience, Ms. Kusanagi. Patience. You will learn as you go. We find that hands-on experience is the most effective teacher.” He gestured towards a stack of datapads on the desk. “These contain preliminary profiles of the individuals you will be working with. Review them carefully. Familiarize yourself with their backgrounds, their known associations.”

Mara reached for the datapad, her fingers brushing against the cool metal. “What kind of individuals are we talking about here? Criminals? Victims? Political dissidents?”

Sato’s smile vanished. “That information is not relevant to your task. Your job is to retrieve the data, not to judge its source. You will be provided with the necessary tools, the neural interface, the decryption algorithms. The rest is up to you.”

Mara stared at him, her distrust growing with each carefully chosen word. “So, no context, no background, no idea what I’m looking for. Just plug in and hope for the best?”

“Precisely,” Sato said, his tone dismissive. “Consider it a… treasure hunt. The clues are hidden within the recesses of the mind. It is your job to find them.”

“And what if I refuse to work on a case?” Mara challenged, pressing him now. “What if I find something morally objectionable?”

Sato sighed dramatically. “Ms. Kusanagi, we are running a business here, not a charity. If you are unable to fulfill your contractual obligations, we will be forced to terminate your employment. I trust you understand.”

The threat hung in the air, unspoken but clear. Mara understood perfectly. She was trapped. She had signed a contract, a contract she hadn’t fully read, lured by the promise of easy money. Now, she was being strong-armed into doing something she didn’t understand, something that felt deeply wrong.

“Is there anything else?” Mara asked, her voice tight with suppressed anger.

“One more thing,” Sato said, reaching into a drawer and pulling out a small, metallic device. “A personal communication device. Encrypted, of course. Use it to contact me if you encounter any… difficulties. And remember, Ms. Kusanagi, discretion is paramount. Do not discuss your work with anyone. Not your friends, not your family, not even your shadow.”

He tossed the device onto the desk. It landed with a dull thud, a symbol of her isolation.

Mara picked it up, her fingers tracing the smooth, cold surface. She looked at Sato, her eyes filled with a mixture of anger and resignation. He was watching her, his expression inscrutable.

“Is that all?” she asked.

“For now,” Sato said, his voice dismissive. “You may begin.”

Mara stood up, grabbing the datapads and the communication device. As she turned to leave, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being manipulated, that she was a pawn in a game she didn’t understand. But the money… the damn money. It was the only thing keeping her here, the only thing anchoring her to this dangerous, uncertain reality.

“Thank you, Mr. Sato,” she said, her voice flat.

She walked out of the office, leaving Sato alone in his opulent prison. As the door hissed shut behind her, she knew one thing for sure: she didn’t trust him. Not one bit. And that was a problem. A very big problem.

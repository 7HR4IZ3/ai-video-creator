The day dawned grey and heavy over the Concrete Jungles, the towering mega-structures of Neo-Kyoto blotting out most of the sky. Rain threatened, a constant drizzle clinging to the grime-coated surfaces. Below, life began its usual frenetic dance. Salarymen hurried to their overcrowded transport pods, their faces etched with exhaustion even before the day had properly begun. Food vendors cranked up their stalls, the synthetic aromas of soy and spice battling for dominance. The usual cacophony of the city – the hum of hovercars, the blare of advertisements, the chatter of a million voices – filled the air.

But today, there was an undercurrent of unease, a nervous tremor beneath the surface. Mara’s broadcast, though cut short, had stirred something. Eyes darted around, conversations were hushed, and there was a palpable tension in the air.

A group of construction workers, perched precariously on a scaffolding repairing a holographic billboard, were arguing. "Did you hear that broadcast yesterday?" Kenzo asked, wiping sweat from his brow. "The one about Kaiba Corp lying?"

"Of course, I did," replied Hiroki, adjusting his safety harness. "Everyone did. But what are we supposed to do about it? Argue with a corporation that owns the sky?"

"Maybe... maybe we should think about what she said," Kenzo insisted. "About our memories. About being controlled."

"Think? We're construction workers, Kenzo, not philosophers. We think about where the next bolt goes. You start thinking too much, you'll fall off this thing.”

Suddenly, a high-pitched whine pierced the air, cutting through the city's noise. It was followed by a low, guttural hum that resonated deep within their chests. They looked up, and their blood ran cold.

Descending from the clouds, like metallic locusts, were the drones. Sleek, black, and menacing, they moved with a speed and precision that was clearly not designed for surveillance. These were weapons. Kaiba Corp’s enforcers.

One drone peeled away from the formation and hovered near the scaffolding. A red light scanned them.

"What the hell is that thing doing?" Hiroki whispered, his voice trembling.

Before Kenzo could answer, the drone unleashed a burst of energy. A searing beam of crimson light sliced through the scaffolding, severing supports and sending chunks of metal and concrete tumbling to the street below. The workers screamed, scrambling for purchase as their fragile platform swayed violently.

"They're attacking us!" Hiroki yelled, grabbing onto a safety line. "They're attacking *us*!"

On the street below, a vendor selling synthetic noodles watched in horror as debris rained down around him. "Hey! Watch it up there!" he shouted, shaking his fist at the sky. He didn't understand. He just wanted to sell noodles.

Another drone descended, targeting the noodle stand. A similar crimson beam obliterated the stall in a flash of light and heat, vaporizing the noodles and sending the vendor sprawling amidst the wreckage.

Panic erupted. People screamed and scattered, shoving each other in a desperate attempt to escape the drones' deadly rain. Hovercars swerved erratically, colliding with each other in a cacophony of metal and sparks. The air filled with the acrid smell of burning metal and the terrified cries of the innocent.

A young mother, clutching her child to her chest, tripped and fell, her shopping spilling across the rain-slicked pavement. A drone swooped down, its red light locking onto them. A salaryman, seeing their plight, threw himself in front of them, shielding them with his body. The beam struck him, incinerating him instantly, leaving behind only a smoking silhouette on the ground.

The mother screamed, her voice a raw, primal sound of grief and terror. She scrambled to her feet, dragging her child with her, running blindly through the chaos.

The drones were indiscriminate. They targeted anyone who hesitated, anyone who looked up, anyone who showed a flicker of defiance or even confusion. They were executing Kaito's orders with brutal efficiency, silencing any potential dissent with lethal force.

The construction workers, miraculously still clinging to the remains of the scaffolding, watched in stunned disbelief as the carnage unfolded below. Kenzo, his face streaked with grime and tears, gripped his safety line with white knuckles.

"This can't be happening," he choked out, his voice barely audible above the screams and explosions. "This is a nightmare."

Hiroki, his eyes wide with terror, just shook his head. "It's real, Kenzo. It's real."

The drones continued their relentless assault, their crimson beams painting the Concrete Jungles with fire and blood. The city, once a symbol of progress and technological marvel, had become a slaughterhouse. All that remained was the terrifying, desperate, chaotic struggle for survival against an overwhelming, merciless force. The seed of hope Mara had planted was being drowned in a flood of fear.

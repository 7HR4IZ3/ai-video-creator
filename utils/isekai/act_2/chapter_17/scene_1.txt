The stale air of the Resistance hideout hung thick with the smell of recycled protein paste and unwashed bodies. Shift change was always a chaotic ballet of groggy faces, mumbled greetings, and the clatter of discarded energy bar wrappers. In the low light of the repurposed subway tunnel, Liam stood near the makeshift command center, a battered table covered in flickering holo-maps of Neo-Kyoto. He was running through the triage distribution plan with Ishikawa, his voice a low murmur barely audible above the drone of the ventilation system.

“Remember, Ishikawa-san,” Liam was saying, pointing to a highlighted sector on the map. “Sector Gamma-Nine is priority. Highest concentration of infected civilians, minimal Kaiba Corp presence. Distribute the cure there first, but be discreet. We can’t afford to draw attention to ourselves.”

Ishikawa, a wiry woman with perpetually tired eyes, nodded. "Understood, Liam. But our supplies are limited. We'll have to make difficult choices."

Liam sighed, running a hand through his close-cropped hair. "I know. Just do your best. And for God's sake, don't let anyone see the priority list. We don't need a riot on our hands."

Across the tunnel, near the entrance camouflaged with expertly applied graffiti and discarded Kaiba Corp propaganda, Kenji was relieving Maya at the security post. Maya, a hulking woman with a shaved head and a cybernetic arm, stretched with a groan.

“Anything to report, Maya?” Kenji asked, already adjusting the outdated surveillance monitors.

“Quiet as a graveyard, Kenji,” Maya grunted, cracking her knuckles. “Just the usual rats and the occasional Kaiba Corp sanitation bot. But something feels off tonight. Like the city's holding its breath.”

Kenji frowned. Maya’s instincts were usually spot on. “I’ll keep my eyes peeled.”

He barely finished the sentence when the world exploded.

A deafening crash echoed through the tunnel as the reinforced steel door buckled inward, spitting sparks and debris. Before anyone could react, a wave of black-clad figures poured into the hideout, weapons raised, their faces obscured by mirrored visors. MIB.

“Resistance! Freeze! Kaiba Corp Security, you are in violation of code 734. Prepare to be terminated!” a synthesized voice boomed from one of the figures.

Chaos erupted. Sleepy resistance members scrambled for weapons, their faces a mixture of surprise and terror. The air filled with the staccato bursts of pulse rifles and the screams of the wounded.

“Damn it! Breach!” Kenji roared, diving behind a stack of crates and drawing his own plasma pistol. He fired blindly, hoping to slow the MIB advance.

Liam, caught off guard near the command center, scrambled for cover behind the overturned table, pulling Ishikawa down with him. “Get to the emergency exit! Now!” he yelled over the din of battle.

Ishikawa, her face pale with fear, nodded and crawled towards the hidden passage behind a false wall.

The MIB moved with ruthless efficiency, their movements precise and coordinated. They were heavily armored, their pulse rifles spitting out bolts of energy that tore through the flimsy cover the Resistance members had managed to find. Resistance members fell left and right, some collapsing in silent heaps, others writhing in agony.

Kenji, firing from behind the crates, managed to take down two of the MIB, but they were like an endless tide, advancing relentlessly. He saw Maya, her cybernetic arm glowing red, holding off three MIB with a furious barrage of gunfire. But even her augmented strength couldn’t hold them back forever.

“We need to fall back! This is a slaughter!” Kenji yelled, trying to rally the scattered Resistance members.

His words were lost in the chaos. Most were too busy fighting for their lives to hear him.

Suddenly, a pulse rifle blast ripped through the crates beside him, sending splinters flying and narrowly missing his head. He ducked, adrenaline coursing through his veins. He had to get out of here, had to warn the others.

He risked a quick glance over the crates. The hideout was a scene of carnage. Bodies littered the floor, the air thick with the smell of ozone and blood. The MIB were advancing steadily, their mirrored visors reflecting the flickering lights of the tunnel like cold, emotionless eyes.

He saw Liam, fighting desperately near the emergency exit, trying to buy Ishikawa time to escape. But he was outnumbered, outgunned. Two MIB had him pinned down, their weapons trained on his chest.

“Liam! No!” Kenji screamed, firing a desperate shot that momentarily distracted the MIB.

But it was too late. The MIB opened fire, and Liam crumpled to the ground.

Kenji felt a surge of rage, a burning desire to avenge his fallen comrade. But he knew it was suicide to stay and fight. He had to escape, had to warn the others.

He turned to flee, but a searing pain erupted in his leg. He stumbled, collapsing to the ground. He looked down to see a smoking hole in his thigh, the result of a lucky shot from one of the MIB.

He tried to get up, but his leg wouldn’t support him. Pain shot through his body with every movement. He was trapped.

The MIB advanced on him, their weapons raised. He closed his eyes, bracing for the end.

“Kenji Tanaka, you are under arrest for violation of Kaiba Corp security codes 234, 578, and 912. Resistance is futile. Cooperate, and your sentence will be reduced.”

Kenji spat on the ground, a defiant gesture in the face of certain capture. “Go to hell, Kaiba Corp.”

The MIB didn’t respond. They grabbed him roughly, ignoring his struggles, and hauled him to his feet. He cried out in pain as they dragged him towards the entrance, past the bodies of his fallen comrades, past the shattered remnants of their hideout, past the cold, unyielding gaze of the MIB.

As they dragged him away, he caught a glimpse of Maya, her cybernetic arm sparking and smoking, being subdued by three MIB. Her eyes met his, a silent message of defiance and despair passing between them. Then, the world went black. The MIB had slammed the butt of a pulse rifle into his temple, rendering him unconscious. The safety of the hideout was gone, replaced by the cold, harsh reality of capture and defeat.

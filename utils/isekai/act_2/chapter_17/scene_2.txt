The first thing Mara registered was the ringing. A high-pitched whine that burrowed into her skull, amplified by the dust-choked air. Then came the smell: ozone, acrid and metallic, mixed with the sickly sweet scent of blood. She lay sprawled amongst the rubble, a tangle of limbs and broken concrete, the world a blurry kaleidoscope of grey and flickering emergency lights.

She pushed herself up, grunting with the effort. Her head throbbed, and her left arm screamed in protest. She glanced around, her breath catching in her throat. The hideout, their sanctuary, was a charnel house. Crates were splintered, consoles smashed, and the walls were pockmarked with scorch marks. Bodies lay scattered like discarded dolls, their faces frozen in expressions of terror.

"Ishikawa?" she croaked, her voice raspy. The ringing in her ears made it difficult to hear.

A cough, weak and ragged, answered her. She followed the sound, stumbling over debris, until she saw him huddled behind a toppled server rack. Ishikawa, his face streaked with grime and blood, was clutching his side.

"Mara," he said, his voice barely a whisper. "They... they hit us hard."

She knelt beside him, ignoring the sharp pain in her arm. "How bad?"

He winced, pressing a hand tighter against his ribs. "Bad. I think... I think one of my ribs is broken." He coughed again, a fleck of blood staining his lips. "Did... did anyone make it?"

Mara scanned the ruins again, her stomach churning. She recognized faces among the dead: Liam, Maya, even young Hiro, who'd been so excited about his first proper hack last week. "I... I don't know," she said, her voice trembling. "I haven't seen anyone else."

A long, heavy silence descended, broken only by the crackling of damaged equipment and Ishikawa's shallow breathing. The weight of their loss pressed down on them, suffocating.

"They knew," Ishikawa said finally, his voice low and bitter. "They knew exactly where we were, exactly when to strike."

Mara's blood ran cold. "A leak? But who?"

"Who do you trust, Mara?" Ishikawa asked, his eyes narrowed, suspicion hardening his features. "Really trust? After this?"

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication. Paranoia, a venomous serpent, began to coil in Mara's gut. She thought of Kenji, always so cheerful, so optimistic. Could he...? No. She shook her head, trying to dispel the thought. But the seed of doubt had been planted.

"It could have been anyone," she said, trying to sound more confident than she felt. "A compromised comm, a careless word..."

"Or someone on the inside," Ishikawa countered, his gaze unwavering. "Someone who knew our plans, our routines, our weaknesses."

Mara flinched. He was right. The attack had been too precise, too efficient. The MIB had moved with an almost preternatural knowledge of their hideout.

"We need to get out of here," she said, pushing herself to her feet. "They'll be back to clean up."

Ishikawa nodded, wincing as he tried to stand. Mara helped him, supporting his weight as they navigated the treacherous terrain.

"Where do we go?" he asked, his voice strained. "Everything's gone. Our resources, our contacts..."

"We rebuild," Mara said, her voice hardening. "We find who did this, and we make them pay." She paused, her eyes narrowing. "But first, we disappear. They can't find us if they don't know where to look."

They limped towards the emergency exit, a narrow tunnel leading into the city's underbelly. As they reached the entrance, Mara stopped, turning back to survey the wreckage of their hideout. The flickering lights cast long, grotesque shadows, painting a grim tableau of death and destruction. The hope they had nurtured, the belief that they could make a difference, lay shattered amongst the rubble.

"This isn't over," she vowed, her voice barely a whisper. "We will avenge them. We will survive. And we will expose Kaiba Corp for what they truly are."

Ishikawa nodded, his face grim. "Then let's get to work."

They stepped into the darkness, leaving behind the ruins of their former lives and embracing a future shrouded in uncertainty, fuelled by grief, anger, and a burning desire for revenge. The air hung heavy with the promise of retribution.

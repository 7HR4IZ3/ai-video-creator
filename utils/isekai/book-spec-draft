Genre: Speculative Fiction / Mystery Thriller 
Place: Neo-Kyoto, a sprawling, neon-drenched metropolis built on reclaimed land, known for its advanced technology and stark social inequalities. The city is divided into gleaming corporate sectors and decaying, overcrowded lower districts. 
Time: 2077 
Theme:  *   Memory as a commodity and weapon. *   Corporate and government control through technology. *   The blurring lines between reality and fabricated memory. *   Individual struggle against systemic corruption. *   The psychological impact of memory manipulation. 
Tone: Gritty, atmospheric, cynical with moments of vulnerability. Think *Blade Runner* meets *Minority Report*, but with a focus on the psychological toll rather than action spectacle. 
Point of View: Primarily Third-Person Limited, focusing on Mara Voss's perspective. Occasional shifts to key secondary characters for brief interludes (e.g., the antagonist, a conflicted ally) to build suspense and reveal information Mara doesn't have. 
Characters:  
Premise:   1.  Councilor Sato hires Mara to retrieve a specific memory fragment – a recording of a secret meeting – stolen from his mind. He claims it was a personal matter, but Mara quickly realizes it implicates him in a conspiracy. 2.  Mara dives into Sato's mind, navigating layers of constructed memories and security protocols. She recovers the fragment, but it's incomplete and corrupted, hinting at a larger cover-up involving the MIB. 3.  Mara is immediately targeted by the MIB, who attempt to erase her own memories to prevent her from investigating further. She barely escapes with Kenji's help. 4.  Mara seeks out Dr. Ishikawa, hoping to understand the extent of the memory manipulation and how to protect herself. Ishikawa reveals that the MIB is developing a technology to rewrite memories on a mass scale. 5.  As Mara delves deeper, she uncovers connections between the stolen memory, the MIB's technology, and her own fragmented past, suggesting she was a target of memory manipulation long ago. ```
